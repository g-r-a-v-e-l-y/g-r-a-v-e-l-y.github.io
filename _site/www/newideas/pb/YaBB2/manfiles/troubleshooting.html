    <td><font size="3"><B>Question/Error:</B></font></td>
    <td><font size="3"><B>Answer:</B></font></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i>I am getting "500 Internal Server Error"!</i></td>
    <td>Did you upload the file in ascii? Also make sure that you chmod the file 755. Also, sometimes when the server your 
    YaBB is installed on is busy, it may decide to choke like this for no reason.. it's NOT a YaBB bug. One last resort is that 
    this file-extension version of YaBB doesn't work on your server. Most servers will allow .cgi files but some do not allow 
    .pl files. In this case, please download the other file version of Y1G from www.yabb.org.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i>Why does my browser ask me to download the script files when I tried to go to my YaBB? (i.e. the infamous "Download 
    Bug" that people think exists)</i></td>
    <td>You can be completely assured that this isn't a bug in YaBB. This is your own mistake or a server problem. First make 
    sure the chmod permissions are proper on the .pl files. Next, be sure that you uploaded them to your account's cgi-bin.
    As a last resort, you may have to modify YaBB and rename the .pl's to .cgi's because your server may not support executing 
    .pl files.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i>I keep getting "Incorrect Password" errors when I try to modify my settings through the Admin Center</i></td>
    <td>It may do this the first time you modify your settings online (and probably will if you have upgraded from an 
    old version). If you chmod'd your Settings.pl file correctly, settings will be saved and you shouldn't get this password 
    error again. When you do, just click "logout", then log back in.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i>Some of my images aren't showing and some are not displaying right.</i></td>
    <td>Make sure that your images directory is properly set in Settings.pl to where your images actually are.
    Also be sure that you uploaded the images in Binary mode.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i>Why are the colors funny in browsers that don't support CSS?</i></td>
    <td>Because they don't support CSS, the color settings in Settings.pl will control the colors in those browsers.
    Be sure that you set the colors in template.html equivalent to those in Settings.pl.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i>Ok, people are telling me the news screws up in their browser!!!</i></td>
    <td> You have the option of turning the NewsFader off in Settings.pl... some browsers don't like the 
    java associated with this news ticker. If you do this and still wish to have news, you'll need to put the 
    tag "&lt;yabbnews&gt;" back into template.html.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i>How can I turn off some of those bloat-fish features?</i></td>
    <td>Many of the features/add-ons in YaBB can be turned off or modified in Settings.pl.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i>When I try to post or change my profile, nothing changes?</i></td>
    <td>Did you forget to chmod 666 (or 777) the files and folders as specified above? That makes them "writeable"....</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i>Well what the hell is chmod?</i></td>
    <td>Chmod is a unix command - for "change mode". It sets permissions to files such as "writeable", "readable", 
    "user-writeable".. etc. You can do this on some servers in your FTP client. On others you may have to telnet (or SSH) to 
    the server and type something such as "chmod # filename". An example is: chmod 777 Settings.pl</td>
