<H2>Advanced settings:</H2>

You should only read this section after you have installed your YaBB (or upgraded) and verified that it is properly 
working by testing it. After you do so, the following explanations will help you set up your advanced YaBB settings. Once the 
board is working, you can also setup your YaBB settings through the "Admin Center" (while logged in on your YaBB board as the 
admin).

<P><B>Required Settings</B><BR>

The following settings are required for a properly working YaBB board. You should have already set these up before you read 
this page.

<pre>
   <i>require "english.lng"</i>        Change to the language pack you wish to use
   <i>$mbname</i>			The name of your YaBB forum
   <i>$boardurl</i>			URL of your board's folder (without trailing '/') - where YaBB.pl is located
   <i>$cookieusername</i>		Name of the username cookie (no change necessary)
   <i>$cookiepassword</i>		Name of the password cookie (no change necessary)
   <i>$mailprog</i>			Location of your sendmail program (generally "/usr/sbin/sendmail" or similar)
   <i>$webmaster_email</i>		Your e-mail address (must have the slash in it as shown "webmaster\@mysite.com")

   <i>$boarddir</i>			Absolute path to the board's folder (usually can be left as '.')

   <i>$sourcedir</i>			Directory with YaBB source files (can be left alone unless you wish to move elsewhere)

The remaining settings in Settings.pl are not required, but are only feature and layout variables. It is recommended that 
you do not change them until you get YaBB working! After that, have fun....<BR><BR>

<P><B>The Remaining Settings</B><BR>

The following lists the remainder of the settings. These are settings that help customize your board and turn options on/off.
