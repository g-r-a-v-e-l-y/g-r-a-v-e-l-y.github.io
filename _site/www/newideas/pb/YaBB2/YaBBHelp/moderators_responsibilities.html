More than doing anything else the Moderator is responsible for maintaining interest in, and activity on, a board. You've got to get people <I>to</I> the board and keep them posting. Boards see ups and downs. Usually a board will see a flurry of initial activity, then settle down for while only to go into high-gear again because of one hot topic. As a Moderator, you'll need to help with jump-starts during slow periods.
<BR><BR>

You will also have the ability to modify, move, and delete all posts on your board. This ability must be handled with responsibility. The users and staff are trusting you with that power and responsibility, please weild it wisely.
<BR><BR>

Moderators also have the responsibility to keep harmful or offensive posts and people out of their boards and to help keep them out of YaBB as a whole. Now when we say "harmful or offensive" we don't mean as judged by any religious or political scale; we also don't mean the presence of profanity, on-topic sexuality, or even disagreements between members. We're all grown ups here, and if we don't want to read something, we don't have to. YaBB has a stated policy of non-censorship. What we mean when we say "harmful or offensive" is material that is unequivocally an abuse of the system itself, the exploitation for commercial gain or maliscious intent of the congregation of the membership general and our ability to freely communicate.  We mean blatant advertisements, posts about money-making-schemes or mlm's, multiple posts with identical content ("bombing" or "spamming" or "cross-posting"), or attacks against members or YaBB that have been written by individuals whose only reason for being here seems to be to attack.
<BR><BR>

Please read <A HREF="moderators_actions.guts.html" TARGET="guts">Actions A Board Moderator May Take</A>, which explains everything from how to handle a topic or post that is better suited on a different board, to dealing with get-rich-quick spammers and other jackasses bulletin board systems sometimes draw and who might appear on your board.
<BR><BR>

We've tried to prepare you for any situation you might encounter, but in reality, you probably won't have to deal with anything more serious than the occassional fixing of a type-o. The most important thing to remember is to have fun. That's what it's all about.
