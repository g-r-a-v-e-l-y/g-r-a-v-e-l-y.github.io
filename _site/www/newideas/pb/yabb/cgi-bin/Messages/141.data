Idea|NoccY|NoCtuRn4L@hotmail.com|02/17/01 at 20:33:50|NoccY|question|0|24.4.253.6|I'm about to propose something which is generally something i dont do. As most of you know i am a quiet person for the most part, But i believe this is something that could help us out. (maybe)<br>Most sports teams, Football, Baseball, Hockey, etc. etc.... And almost all organized activities have some sort of a &quot;coach&quot;. So this is what i am proposing, A type of coach that comes up with strategies on map, watches demos,games,intra scrims, so on and so forth, and then directs off of them. I mean no disrespect to anyone and i hope none is taken, but.... as it stands right now alot of the discussions we have about map strategies, people placement, is difficult becuz there are so many different ideas out there. Which is great!!!!!! Yet it doesnt help us resolve anything. Think of it this way (no offense to any non U.S. citizens) But do u think that the united states would be the power house it is without a Defensive or Offensive coordinator? The guy callin the shots? I dont think so. But anyway this is what i propose any comments suggestions or if i should just be shot in the head lemme know. (Cuz for all I know this may be a dumb idea!!!!!!) thx NoccY
