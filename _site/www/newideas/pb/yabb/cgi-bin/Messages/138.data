map strat for cpm4|stereotype|m-roberts4@northwestern.edu|02/17/01 at 02:35:54|stereotype|xx|0|199.74.102.94|First of all I want to appologize to you Lionel<br>for not having listened in the way i should have earlier.<br><br>I think we need a comprehensive stratagy for cpm4 - yes - but all 4 RA might not be as good as I thought.<br><br>After our discussion I was thinking about what you said and have to admit that I think there is a good middle ground we can work with.<br><br>I talked a lot to SNB gunmetal about cpm4 and he kindly explained to me in detail how SNB plays this map.<br><br>When reading this following IRC log please imagine you with someone being the teams that runs the map and Tom along with someone who locks RA from the top.<br><br><br>--------------------------------------------------<br><br><br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; sup bro<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; dont tell me u wanna cyber<br><br>&lt;estereotype&gt; hehe<br><br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; whats on yo mind?<br><br>&lt;estereotype&gt; i was wondering how comfortable you feel with cpm4 as a map and if you wouldn't mind giving me your take on that map<br><br>(...)<br><br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; I feel its a very solid map, not one weapon dominated and very diverse in terms of strat<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; the team holding ra, doesn't necessarly win<br><br>&lt;estereotype&gt; so how does snb play it?<br>&lt;estereotype&gt; do you guys aim for an all 4 RA setup like dm7?<br><br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; sorta<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; cept<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; u dont wanna do that and let enemy get everything else everyhwere<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; sometimes its good to have 2 solid ra campers<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; while other 2 roam to either quad or pg/ya<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; key on that map is staying together<br><br>&lt;estereotype&gt; ic<br><br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; cuz while u fight one guy with rl<br>and ur teammate plugs him in da back with sg u can completely own it<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; but when ur at ra<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; stay HIGH<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; dont come down, dont chase the frags<br><br>&lt;estereotype&gt; so you are basically saying groups of 2 and when RA gets tight the second group running the map helps at RA?<br><br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; yes<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; exactly<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; but u have to converge well for quad<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; if u get control<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; and follow it up with a good quad run<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; u can lock the map for a few minutes<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; and just spawn rape<br><br>&lt;estereotype&gt; if you DO have RA do you think it's better going late for quad or setting up?<br><br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; those two roaming can be the first at quad<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; and they can try to just rock spam the enemy out of the area<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; key is to get in that position<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; its a bitch to get on that rl ledge<br>when enemy is tehre with weapons<br><br>&lt;estereotype&gt; when you guys have a match on cpm4 let's say...do you guys decide firmly beforehand who bilds the groups of 2 and keep them throughout the game, or do you just go with whoever is around during the game and switch according to situation?<br><br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; no that's decided beforhand<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; for instance<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; boodah and i are like the aggressive types<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; we can handle multiple enemies etc<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; while king/aph would be the more defensive<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; they stay high and time armor<br><br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; i forgot to mention that<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; if u wanna win<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; time the armors<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; snb times mega in dm7<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; we took so many megas vs ck<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; that's their strat even<br><br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; i suggest scrimming nB<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; they're good on cpm4<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; as sh1tty as they are<br><br>&lt;estereotype&gt; hehe<br>&lt;estereotype&gt; better then us for sure :P<br><br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; bah<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; u can take em soon if u keep up the determination<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; get gladiac playing i like him<br><br>&lt;estereotype&gt; hehe <br>&lt;estereotype&gt; :)<br>&lt;estereotype&gt; he's been having connect issues<br>&lt;estereotype&gt; should be fit within days though<br>&lt;estereotype&gt; you mind if i ask a few more questions? :P<br>&lt;estereotype&gt; this is helping a great deal :)<br><br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; go ahead<br><br>&lt;estereotype&gt; let's say you get into a situation in which you loose complete control over RA how do you get back...<br>&lt;estereotype&gt; both teams focus on the YA's ?<br>&lt;estereotype&gt; like team &quot;a&quot; PG/YA and team &quot;b&quot; Q/RL/YA and then try to get Quad?<br><br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; well<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; in that case<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; try to box the enemy in before they try to lock the map<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; get either pg/ya or rl/quad control<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; often u can steal the lg<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; but its helpful man<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; time ra<br><br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; if u steal ra they'll be holding the area for no reason<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; and u can just spam rox into ra-quad entrances<br><br>&lt;estereotype&gt; good point<br><br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; the point is poise<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; regrouping asap<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; tell ur teammates not to keep cessing unless the entire team is making the effort<br><br>&lt;estereotype&gt; mid if i log this conversation and pass it around to a few other e members for discussion's sake?<br><br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; go ahead we're cool<br><br>&lt;estereotype&gt; this is a good summary of some good strat :)<br>&lt;estereotype&gt; we're not playing same tier anyways :)<br><br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; ya<br><br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; i dont mind man cuz even with me tellin u this<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; u guys will revise<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; and make it better<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; so<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; it'll be fun<br><br>&lt;estereotype&gt; thank you so much man<br>&lt;estereotype&gt; that's cool of you taking the time really<br><br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; take it easy<br><br>&lt;estereotype&gt; thanks :)<br>&lt;estereotype&gt; g'night <br><br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; no problemo<br>&lt;snb^gunmetal&gt; nite
Re: map strat for cpm4|pete|techagq3@home.com|02/17/01 at 08:03:22|e.xtasy|xx|0|24.17.74.152|yea man . thats a pretty healthy strat, and i say it should work well, lets get some practice on it maybe tonight or something, thats really sweet of gunmetal to give us some inside tips , make sure we all tell him ty :o) <br><br>Now, I am not wholly unfamiliar with 2 , 2 person teams on a map , its the kind of strat that FL (Fully Loaded) Used to use on maps like dm6, and sometimes they work rather well, , sometimes it is alot easier trying to defend and help just one other player instead of 3, when your trying to hold a position, and if you know anything about 2v2 tdm , then reliying on one other person can make the differnce between life and death, I think if we fing a person that we work well with , then we should try to play with that eprson in a camp situation like gun mentioned on cpm4, Like gun said , choose the ppl who like to camp , and put them on RA, i personally like to roam , but as of late i havent been getting the frags like i used to doing so, I know Monty is a definite roamer, since he can score multiple frags chewing on stragglers of the lower and off way points of a map, Noccy, I think your strong too, and you like to raom, perhaps you and MOnty, could roam together, Thrash, you and i could hold the ra at all costs , We just need to try this in a inner with all of us to see how we do <br><br>Let me know what you guys think
Re: map strat for cpm4|Lionel|lionel2b@yahoo.com|02/17/01 at 11:51:49|MonTy|xx|0|24.185.233.159|I agree with pete , I think we can be VERY solid on this map . We just have to try things out. &nbsp;Practise is the main thing , which we need everybody to show up. &nbsp;This is really an important time in our clan for badlands. We need to do this. I'm willing to put all my effort in as long as I see every1 else doing the same. &nbsp;I'm really happy about this map , but we have to play q3ngiarena2 also. We still don't have a solid strat.
Re: map strat for cpm4|NoccY|NoCtuRn4L@hotmail.com|02/17/01 at 12:08:01|NoccY|xx|0|12.26.69.11|I agree with all that has been said here and i agree with gun as well. Timing as always is the key to success on this map. I as most of you know<br>am a roamer. I do like to go out and roam on maps and make the kills. which also can be bad in the same respect that my eff shows it. But I too am also willing to put forth the effort to make this work. Badlands is important to our clan at this early stage, for us to establish a reputation, This is our &quot;proving grounds&quot; of sorts. Lionel, arena 2 is very important as well but we play cpm4 twice the first week. So its my opinion that we be very solid on this map and then work on arena2. Any thoughts?<br>
Re: map strat for cpm4|flood|supamart@email.com|02/17/01 at 12:22:03|flood|xx|0|24.4.252.249|that is so sweet! &nbsp;that strat basically covers what to do in the main situations that you'd get into on that map. &nbsp;So if the roamers could get control of that YA (and the PG SG &amp; RL/quad surrounding that area) while 2 were in control of the RA/RL converging on quad, we could do so some serious damage boys! :D &nbsp;I'd really love to experience that much control of the map.. &nbsp;
Re: map strat for cpm4|flood|supamart@email.com|02/17/01 at 13:25:01|flood|xx|0|24.4.252.249|heh.. and there's the other YA of course!! (man i feel stupid...) &nbsp; =l<br> &nbsp;
