how to decide on starting lineup|flood|supamart@email.com|02/15/01 at 17:29:55|flood|xx|0|24.4.252.248|I think the most accurate way is to make a log of efficiency for each scrim we play, then take the avg eff of each player after like 10 games (or less?).. &nbsp;along with each eff log for each player, there should be a note of how bad or good that particular match went with the eff. Otherwise some dood could have played in 10 bad games (and maybe they suck when things go bad like i do most of the time ;) while another played in a buncha good games showing a higher eff avg. &nbsp; <br><br>I know this doesn't include communication and other team skillz, but we can use these things to help better decide along with efficiency logs... &nbsp;<br><br>Tell me what you guys think... &nbsp;After typin this out the idea seems a bit too complex, but if we could figure out how to incorporate the info on how good/bad games went, it seems like it would be the most accurate way (note I said, &nbsp;'seems' :). &nbsp;oh, the easiest and simplest way we could do it is just by having a vote.... &nbsp;there's my 2 cents...<br><br>-flood &nbsp;

It seems to me a tad too impersonal and migth cause internal competition in a bad way.<br><br>People at practice should feel like thye can experiment and try out things, with this eff thingy everyone will be under heavy pressure - too much pressure and it might take the fun out of things.

Re: how to decide on starting lineup|flood|supamart@email.com|02/15/01 at 17:46:09|flood|xx|0|24.4.252.248|okay, that all makes total sense especially what rice said (wtf are u?! haha)... stupid idea!<br><br>so what else can we do? my only other idea was to have a vote... &nbsp; <br>
Re: how to decide on starting lineup|thibault|jadedxux@hotmail.com|02/15/01 at 17:47:44|Guest|exclamation|0|206.47.244.57|omg omg! thibault here to bust his 2 cents, i think we should all practice and all learn to be as good as everyone else, like every other clan there will obviously be more dominant players. However I believe the key to success is a well rounded lineup where no matter who starts you can trust them and be reliant that they will do well. Having constant starters would be good in a way, expect not everyone would get to play important games when winning might make them feel good about themselves. Anyways, 'starting Lineup' = good, &nbsp;but give everyone a kick at the can :P Bcuz I dunno but I think everyone here has the potential to start :) &nbsp; &nbsp; -Thib!!!!

Re: how to decide on starting lineup|pete|techagq3@home.com|02/15/01 at 19:51:44|e.xtasy|xx|0|24.17.74.152|well flood thats a good idea, hehe and if your suggestion going off eff hehe ill never make a starting lineup HAHA, but with that said there is some truth into what your say9ing, it will help us all strive to play more accurate, and more effeciently, &nbsp; <br><br>Now with a word on how to do it, it should be every players responsibllility , to record and document there effecency, by doing /condump &lt;filename&gt; when doing any type of scrim or match, now with that said , i know that text files can be edited, SOOOOOOOOooooooo the thing to do is have them uploded to a secure FTP the MInute the matches ect is over, thats the only way i cant hink of having it done
demos|Lionel|lionel2b@yahoo.com|02/15/01 at 20:44:21|MonTy|smiley|0|24.185.233.159|I think demos is the best way to go to decide the starting line up.. Everyone records demos and a few ppl watch it. Also I think flesh and Noccy can't play in the badlands games cuz they entered late on teamplay.net ?<br>
Re: how to decide on starting lineup|stereotype|m-roberts4@northwestern.edu|02/16/01 at 00:10:36|stereotype|xx|0|199.74.102.94|nah they can...<br><br>they just wouldn't be allowed to switch from one team to another - so they are ok.<br><br>i read up on the rules and i am positive they can.<br><br>so &lt;3
