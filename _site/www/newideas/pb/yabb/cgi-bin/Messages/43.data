My config and binds.|Monty||10-20-2000 at 07:20 PM|Monty|xx|0|127.0.0.1|Well my config has been tweaked for over a year and I think it is really good to fit my style. Everyones is different so dont expect to like it , but it may help. Its not a normal config , it explains everything in it. Took me awhile , but I did it :) .. here it is.<br>http://www.geocities.com/monty_74/q3config.zip<br>.<br>Also new team binds I made up , which I tried out and works perfect.. Really fits each situation. :( change your bind to a button and add to config)( I choose red and yellow because the colors catches your eye and its the first thing you see. Proven fact.<p>bind ' "say_team ^3&lt;---^9STAY HERE"<br>bind , "say_team ^3***^9Group\Attack QUAD^3***"<br>bind . "say_team ^3***^9Group/Attack RL^3***"<br>bind / "say_team ^3***^9Group/Attack RA^3***"<br>bind [ "say_team ^3**^9^3*^9Negative/Cancel that^3***"<br>bind ] "say_team ^8^8^3**^(^9^3*^9Affirmitive/On My Way^3***"<br>bind b "say_team ^3***^4Mega ^9Taken^3***"<br>bind h "say_team ^3***^9Health/Armor Availible^3***"<br>bind i "say_team ^3^3&lt;---^9DONT COME/ENEMIES CAMPING"<br>bind j "say_team ^3***^9Gun/Ammo Availible^3***"<br>bind k "say_team ^3***^(^9Need Health/Armor^3***"<br>bind l "say_team ^3***^9Need Gun/Ammo^8^3***"<br>bind m "say_team ^3&lt;---^9GROUP HERE"<br>bind n "say_team ^3***^(^9QUAD in 10^3***"<br>bind o "say_team ^3&lt;---^9UNDER ATTACK/HELP"<br>bind p "say_team ^3&lt;---^9I^9m Here"<p>Remember to change the part where it says bind (your letter) to your keys you want to use.Enjoy , additional tips or binds would be great :)<p>
My config and binds.|CS6x||10-20-2000 at 11:58 PM|CS6x|xx|0|127.0.0.1|I would personally edit the bind: "mega taken" to <br>"&lt;--- item taken", thereby it would apply to RA, YA and any form of weapon.<p>In addition I find the system of splitting binds very usefull.<br>For example:<p>"attack/regroup here..."<br>"enemies camping here/avoid..."<br>"RA"<br>"Quad"<br>"RL"<p>The problem with this bind: "&lt;--- enemy camping here", is that it only works if you are actually IN the room while using the bind.<br>Let's say you are about to walk in to quad, see enemies and retreat before actually entering.<br>Now what? How are you going to communicate the enemies position? Walk into quad - push button - walk out again? :) That is where I think split binds come in. Gives you more flexibility, on the other hand you need to press two buttons instead of one...therby making yourself vulnerable for a longer period. Up to you I guess.
