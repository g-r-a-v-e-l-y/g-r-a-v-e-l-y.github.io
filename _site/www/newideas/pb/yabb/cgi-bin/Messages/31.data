irc script?|grant||10-27-2000 at 12:39 AM|grant|xx|0|127.0.0.1|If anyone reads this and has any idea how to script some display stuff in irc, i'd like a script that would replace the new buzzwords "forking", "witch", and "shoot" with the words they actually stand for. I'm no explative zealot, but i'm afraid all my friends have turned into fucking idiots and won't stop talking like pokemon card collecting fifth graders out for a wild night at the skating rink that just can't seem to shake that one parent that has to feel involved. <p>Who started this fad? It was very strange to watch infect everyone and I must say, it's about the lamest shit i've ever heard. <p>If someone could just point me to a script that would do the work for me, i'd be much obliged.<p>thanks!<p>Grank<br>
