Welcome to the real world Neo|John Kline|raildog@bellsouth.net|01/14/01 at 17:43:54|Guest|xx|0|209.214.173.86|Hello all, I apologize for my long hiatus, moving out to the country is nice! However, 56k sucks, and I don't have a true timetable as to when dsl will be available.<br> &nbsp;It would be best to consider me an inactive member, although I will stop by irc as much as possible when I'm online. I would appreciate some demos of matches, games, etc. I am starving for some competition, and watching would help me feel like I was there in some way.<br> &nbsp;I hope school is going well for all of you. My new email address is: raildog@bellsouth.net<br> Everyone take it easy,<br><br> &nbsp;John T. KLine<br> &nbsp; aka Raildog
