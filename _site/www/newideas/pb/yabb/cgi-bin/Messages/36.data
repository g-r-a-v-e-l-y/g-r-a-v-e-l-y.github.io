Specific example can be found in the recent debate centered around digital video discs (DVD's) and their use. <br>	DVD is a compact disc based format capable of holding nine gigabytes of interactive video and music.  Unlike a traditional audio compact disc, each DVD is encrypted using the CSS cypher created by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and the Digital Video Copy Control Association (DVD-CCA), an organization whose sole existance is based on the licensing of keys for the cypher. Consequently, to play back the video contained on a DVD, one must use a player licensed by the DVD-CCA. <br>	This restriction has no impact on the general public. Hardware players typically purchased in home audio/video retail outlets are all examples of licensed decryptors of the CSS. In the computer world, DVD's can be played on any personal computer equipped with decryption software. Here, the problem presents itself. Software decryption programs must be written for each operating system on which one wishes to watch DVD movies. As of yet, the operating systems for which licensed software exists has been limited to the Microsoft Windows and Macintosh platforms. While these two operating systems account for a vast majority of the general populace, they still restrict who can watch DVD movies on a computer. Users of any variety of unix or it's linux based clones were forced to come up with a different solution.<br>	Created by a vast number of computer programmers in the fall of 1999 and presented to the world by sixteen year old Jon Johansen, DeCSS is the first unlicensed decryption software for DVD data in existence. The software performs exactly the same function as the MPAA/DVD-CCA licensed hardware and software players without an official for the CSS encryption.  The MPAA immediately began filing law suits claiming that the DeCSS violated intellectual propery laws; primarily the American Digital Millenium Copyright Act by working as a "circumvention device". Here, a circumvention device is defined as a device whose sole purpose is to break protection against illegal copying of copyrighted content. <br>	This is not the case. Besides the license from the DVD-CCA, the De-CSS based DVD software players perform no function not perfomed by licensed software. The MPAA also argues that the De-CSS functions as a means to copy directly the data from a DVD and save the decrypted video to a computer hard disk. This is a valid point but not De-CSS' sole purpose and DeCSS isn't the only program that is capable of performing this operation. The MPAA wants DVD technology to remain a closed loop with the money leading back to their pockets in ways that CD's and cassettes (audio and VHS) have not been. Is this a bad thing?<br>	Intellectual property is a great portion of the data on which our economy is based. But does a corporation have the right to restrict what one does with this property once purchased? This central question is not just vital to the DeCSS controversy but to all future decisions for which it will set precendence.<p><br>	<p>gstavelyg: http://decss.cyberspace.cz/info.html<br>gstavelyg: http://www.lemuria.org/DeCSS/decss.html
