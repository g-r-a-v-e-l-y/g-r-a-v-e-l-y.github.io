RM match|NoccY|NoCtuRn4L@hotmail.com|02/19/01 at 11:25:52|NoccY|angry|0|12.26.69.9|Well as most of you know. We lost our first match vs RM. Well it happens these guys had it really down on cpm4. Quads and armor were abundant for them. Im not gonna make excuses about my ping for my poor performance. (god i wish we had made an issue outta that server) but oh well! Anyway thx to aga for goin in for me at the end of game 1 dood i was all over the place skippin around like mad. Anyway I think we underestimated these guys a<br>little which partly is my fault. I made the comment that we should roll over these guys. We didnt. THey have definately improved there game over the past 6-8 mths since i played them. I think we need to have some good practices with quad runs and takin ra. Back to the basics. But then again who am i? well gonna run. O btw for those of you that dont know we scrimmed stx on dm6 last night with Vakal. (i think he should be in) scores 175-74 (we actually had the lead for like the first 5 min, I think they were scared!) ROFL. But to my suprise a 100 frag loss to a clan like them isnt bad. They even made the comment that we played better than some of the EQL clans!!!!!!!!! w00t gg us. Anyway, from here on out no more losses! Time to get down and dirty.<br> &nbsp; NoccY
