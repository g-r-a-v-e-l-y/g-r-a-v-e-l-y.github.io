match against m|grant||10-21-2000 at 03:32 PM|grant|xx|0|127.0.0.1|there are a rather large number of reasons why we got owned that game. :(<p>1. [m] was a team of quality players. I would estimate that at least two of them were "thrash" level and two were my level. The emphasised part in that statement is that they were a <b>team</b> of quality players.<p>2. We didn't have our "starter" team playing. No ofense to those that did play, but I would suggest our starter team consists of monty, thrash, mark, and doug. I would also suggest (no beef with nate allowed) that all future matches be scheduled around how many of whatever we consider a "starter" team is available at that time.<p>3. Ping - with 3 players under 30 ping, we got railed pretty heavily. Is this only ping? Negative. We got railed so easily because we attacked like black-jumpsuit ninjas.<p>4. 1v1 vs. teamplay. we did <i>decent</i> taking ra room back and sharing the items in the room. As soon as [m] attacked (all at once/together mind you) we fell to 1v1. the guy closest would run in for the attack instead of the guy witht he most appropriate weapon.  I killed Kalabin twice the one time I managed to get quad because he was up close with an mg when he should have been running the hell out of the way (no offense kal) and at the end, as i left, i fragged carnage flat out intentionally (lame of me, apologies) because he was chasing someone with a _gauntlet_ when i was right next to him with an RL. - the point of all of this is that you get the fuck out of the way when a player has superior armaments. <p>5. Nate had a point complaining during the matches that no one was listeing to his command binds. BUT. That was not the case imho. We did listen to his binds, only, as a function of point numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, we just marched in (again - like black-suited ninjas) to the slaughter the majority of the time.<p>I have a few other gripes but these are _huge_ things to work on so i'll discuss the finer points when we are ready for them.<p>:/<p>Again - this isn't meant to shit on anyone that played/didn't play- this is critique that i'd like to think can be constructive.<p>Grant
match against m|Thrash||10-22-2000 at 06:54 PM|Thrash|xx|0|127.0.0.1|Again, sorry I couldn't make it. I thought about walking 20 mins to the library to post a message on this board about not being able to make it because my connection was out, or something similar to that. I hope someone sues NYU because of their internet downtime and/or capacity overflow. Maybe then they will realize that they can't just steal our money and use it for their own purposes.<p>btw: what does "'thrash' level" mean anyway? Did those two players get the two lowest scores those two games? hehe j/k :P
