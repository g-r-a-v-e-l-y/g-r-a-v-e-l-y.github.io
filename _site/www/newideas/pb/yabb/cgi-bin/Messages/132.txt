I've been considering the option for the past month or so.. <br><br>when i did the backend redesign, I was aggravated constantly by nn4's css problems, but what i have now is very very elegant imo. The header contents of every page is an include. The navigation is an include. the content is an include. When i update pages now, i'm opening little html files and working with &lt;p&gt;'s instead of monstrous tables. <br><br>Converting the navigation to pure css placement would allow me the luxury of dynamic width amonst a few other things that the tables hacked together don't allow.<br><br>:P<br><br>But i might not even bother! this is a temp site. we shall see.
