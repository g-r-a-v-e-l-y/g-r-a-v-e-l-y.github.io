Essay of Artistic Intent


	The importance of the computer and its interaction with the untrained individual is becoming increasingly important in society. Metaphors have been established. Interface standards have gained popularity. Regardless of the many differences between various graphical user interfaces, all are based on the exchange between the human and the machine. The same can be said about the visual arts. Regardless of the profound differences in artistic genres and media, interaction with an audience is the prime goal. My interest, in both art and computers, is the study of this model. 
	With each increase in hardware possibilities, software developers,  end-users, and artists both visual and otherwise, have risen to press the capabilities of the desktop computer farther and farther. What can be said of the future of this exchange? 
	I struggle often with questions of this level when designing new web sites. With experience this struggle will become more directed, but only with training will I be able to truly focus my creativity. This can be seen as an increase in my hardware possibilities. I will continue pushing my personal creative capabilities farther and farther. What can be said of the future of this exchange?
	With a degree in Digital Imaging I will be better able to comprehend the interaction between the artist and the art viewer. Where this comprehension may take me is still in the future but I know that it will be to my benefit.
