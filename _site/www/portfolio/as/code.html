</SPAN class="title">acid*sun Code of Behaviour for Competition and Practice:</SPAN>
<BR>
<BR>
1.  Respect is free, and should always be given to our opponents and our fellow teammates.
<BR>
<BR>
2.  The integrity of Acid*SuN comes before ourselves, and we must always play in a manner reflecting our honor.
<BR>
<BR>
3.  Players of the level of Acid*SuN do not need to cheat, therefore, we will not cheat or play unfairly.
<BR>
<BR>
4.  Practices are important to the increasing improvement of our team, so it is important to attend them as regularly as possible.
<BR>
<BR>
5.  Your teammates need your support to become better, so build them up, do not tear them down.
<BR>
<BR>
6.  Newbies need help as much as you did when you were a newbie, so treat them with respect.
<BR>
<BR>
7.  Insults during a match, whether justified or not, are not acceptable behaviour for members of Acid*SuN.
<BR>
<BR>
8.  Saying gg (good game) at the end of a match is a sign of good sportsmanship, and should be used whether the match was won or lost.
<BR>
<BR>
9.  Consider yourself a member of an elite team, and this brings with it the necessity to teach others as well as be taught.  Take the time to answer questions asked of you, and do your best to contribute to the growth of all players.
<BR>
<BR>
10.  Lag is a constant in multiplayer online games, so do not make excuses for yourself if it is causing you to play poorly.  Remember: the best players will already know that you are lagging!
<BR>
<BR>
11.  Do not whine or make an excuse after being fragged.
<BR>
<BR>
12.  Gloating after a victory is poor sportsmanship, refrain from such actions as much as possible.
<BR>
<BR>
*  Remember, you are a part of an elite team now, and everything you do will reflect on the clan as a whole.  Do your best to act the part, and our clan will not be tarnished from actions of clan members.
<BR>
<BR>
Special Note:  When in practice, or in a 1v1 match, do not frag a talker or lagger.  In a match however, talkers are very likely communicating with their team about our position or strategy, so it only makes sense to frag them. :)
