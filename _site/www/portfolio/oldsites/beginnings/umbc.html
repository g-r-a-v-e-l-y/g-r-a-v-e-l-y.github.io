		<TD WIDTH="508">Welcome UMBC! Designed with you the Fine Art reviewer in mind, Beginnings functions as both my online portfolio,
			resume, and HTML testing ground. Because my work is primarily done on a computer, and because of my general distrust
			of computer printers of the caliber that I have access to, I decided to create this web page in addition to printing
			and mounting individual pieces of hardcopy. The <A HREF="bio.html">bio</A> page functions as my essay of artistic
			intent as well as an introduction to my history. <BR>
			<BR>
			I had hoped to have all work uploaded by the review date but because of certain technical difficulties I was unable
			to get my video work digitized and had to resort to clumsy VHS. On this tape you will find three individual segments
			completed during my course work at Frederick Community College. These three video projects all aired over the course
			the last semester on Frederick Cablevision channel 23. They are described as follows.<BR>
			<BR>
			1. &quot;<FONT COLOR="#0099FF">College of the Air</FONT>&quot; - This is a commercial for FCC's cable televised
			classes. Borrowing the basic concept from Joe Osmann, the video instructor, I wrote the storyboard, filmed, directed,
			and edited the piece. Starring Pete Backus, another student in the class, and lit by J.R. Voltaglio. The commercial
			was assembled on a Hi-8 linear deck and then broght into a Media 100 for final tweaking. Here, I was able to add
			the backgroun music and better sync the voice-overs. The music heard in the back of both this commercial, and the
			3rd clip, &quot;Kids on Campus&quot; is from my band, Curious Yellow, in which I play guitar. <BR>
			<BR>
			2. &quot;<FONT COLOR="#0099FF">FCC Cable 23 News</FONT>&quot; On this clip, I operated a studio quality three-chip
			cammera with a Hi-8 deck and monitored the sound of the interview portion. This clip was edited by the talent,
			Lisa Sweet. <BR>
			<BR>
			3. &quot;<FONT COLOR="#0099FF">Kids on Campus</FONT>&quot; - My final news piece at FCC, again featuring Curious
			Yellow, I produced, directed, filmed, and edited this segment. Eric Corbin, another FCC student, filmed many of
			the student shots while I was filming the pottery class. Besides that, I had complete control from start to finnish
			and edited the entire thing on FCC's Media 100, allowing me to add titles and graphics. I also set up the lighting,
			set, and cameras for the interview segments.<BR>
