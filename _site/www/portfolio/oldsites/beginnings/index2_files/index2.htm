			<P>Welcome to <A HREF="mailto:zosl@erols.com">Grant Stavely's</A> home page release 2. The actual word based content
			of this page has changed very little from it's predecessor, <A HREF="http://members.xoom.com/curiousyelow/index.html">Quasilateral</A>,
			but the site graphics and layout have been completely revamped. Because I am teaching myself, insight after insight
			continues to advance my abilities and hence this site's possibilities. <BR>
			<BR>
			Constant tweaking punctuated by major updates is my goal. If server space is available to me, I will leave dumped
			designs online as I have done with Quasilateral in the true style of the original &quot;internet&quot;. <BR>
			<BR>
			From now on, updates will be listed here as to the advances I have made and the additions to beginnigs so that
			I can give some sense of the progression made since the beginning of June when I first sat down to sketch out a
			design. <BR>
			<BR>
			This site is best viewed on a computer with a monitor. Specifially, this site is best viewed on <I>my<B> </B></I>computer
			and monitor, not because they are incredible pieces of hardware (they aren't) but because I created the web site
			on them. The images load faster, the window is the right size, and I am here to explain away any mistakes. The
			text you are reading probably looks a tad different from the way it looks for me in Windows98 running IE 5.0 with
			the link underlining turned off at a screen resolution of 600x800 at <I>true color </I>(millions of them in fact)
			and there is a possiblility that it looks a <I>lot</I> different. Cross-platform support is my next project - the
			Mac donation hotline is open and operators are standing by.</P>

			<P class="DATE"><FONT COLOR="#CC3300">7.19.99</FONT> - <FONT COLOR="#0099FF">I have been reading all the literature
			I can get my hands on concerning cascading style sheets and graphic web design to speed up page loading. The style
			sheet ref page has been revamped and a new logo is in the works which can be seen on the bottom of all the pages
			now. I am still in the process of tweaking it both compositionally and file size reduction. Stay tuned...</FONT></P>
