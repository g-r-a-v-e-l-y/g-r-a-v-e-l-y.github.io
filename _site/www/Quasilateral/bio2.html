<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Verdanna, Helvetica, Arial, san-serif">Over the course of my life, like any young
person, my career goal has shifted across multiple fields of study. My current and seemingly final interest revolves
around the use of computers in the visual arts. I predominantly hope to work with three dimensional rendering software
in applications such as architectural modeling, scientific illustration, virtual reality, or cinematic post-production.
This has not always been my ambition, but the steps leading up to it are logical, and knowledge of them is necessary
to fully understand my strengths and weaknesses on the subject. Two narratives may be used to explain my primary
influences, one for computers and one for the arts. <BR>
<BR>
I have been lucky enough to have had a computer of some kind available to me throughout my maturation. My father
bought one of the early Apple IIe clones, a <A HREF="http://www.gondolin.org.uk/hchof/intros/laser128.html">Laser128</A>,
when I was in the third grade. While it was only a platform for games like Swash-Buckler and Pac-man, I am proud
to say that I learned on a computer that was not advanced enough to handle the first versions of Tetris. <BR>
<BR>
The next computer we bought was a <A HREF="http://www.oldskool.org/shrines/pcjr_tandy/">Tandy</A> PC with minimal
RAM, a whopping 20 megabyte hard disk, and an impressive 3.5 inch disk drive. This computer was pre-windows, running
Tandy's <A HREF="http://www.agate.net/~tvdog/deskmate.html"><I>Deskmate</I></A> overtop an early altered version
of Ms-DOS. It was on this machine that I learned basic DOS commands and became familiar with the mechanics of computers
and the language involved in understanding their use. Of course, technology is constantly changing if not improving,
leading to yet another grey, purring box of silicon in the household.<BR>
<BR>
The <A HREF="http://www.direct.ibm.com/cgi-bin/ncommerce/CategoryDisplay?cgrfnbr=552&amp;cgmenbr=1&amp;cntry=840&amp;lang=en_US">IBM
PS/1</A> that was to become my next computer was a disappointment to me in that unlike the computers the family
had previously purchased, it was not on the cutting edge of technology. It was a 486x system clocked at 25 megahertz
with no math co-processor and it had a meager 2 megabytes of RAM and an 80 megabyte hard drive. This was a time
when clock speeds were approaching 100mhz and many new games required more memory than the PS/1 could provide.
In spite of or because of the system's shortcomings, I turned away from gaming and began to actually work on the
computer, generally opting to ignore Windows 3.1 in favor of MS-DOS 5, which we later upgraded to the controversial
version <A HREF="http://www.mcmaster.ca/cis/help/msdos.htm">6.2</A>. Here, I learned the fine art of crashing my
computer and subsequently bringing it back online. A learning process for which I am extremely grateful.<BR>
<BR>
The key feature on this computer was the familiar hole in the back that had previously not had any business on
a computer. A phone jack. A friend gave me a copy of <A HREF="http://www.leo.org/pub/comp/os/dos/communication/terminator/0204t2d1.idx.html">Terminator</A>
and I had my first taste of the local bulletin board scene. I was introduced to what are now everyday concepts
around the world like chat and e-mail along with other less popular ideas like multiple user domains (MUDs) and
online games. This was when a BBS was rated by the number of phone lines it had and the quality of the <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Gallery/4219/main.html">ASCII
or RIPscrip</A> artwork used in the menu systems. What intrigued me the most about these 2400 baud connections
was not that I could chat or play chess with friends, but that I could send information over the phone lines. Downloading
and uploading executables, documents, and files still impresses me, and it is the basis for the information age
we are now in. <BR>
<BR>
I had my own <A HREF="http://www.cdrom.com/simtel.net/msdos/pcboard.html">PCBoard</A> for a month or two but quickly
lost interest when I found that one could dial into Maryland's free internet server, <A HREF="http://www.carr.org/carroll/accounts/">Sailor</A>.
While it was text only, and downloads were limited to the <A HREF="http://dir.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Communications_and_Networking/Software/Kermit/">Kermit</A>
protocol of 2400 baud (I had upgraded to a 14.4 bps modem) I was attracted to the internet for the standard reasons.
Where else can one read useless trivia on nearly any topic? While the PS/1 was at my mom's house, my Dad was still
clunking along on the old Tandy, so when he upgraded, he asked me to help him pick out a computer system.<BR>
<BR>
The new computer was a 90mhz Pentium <A HREF="http://www.compaq.com/">Compaq</A> with a gigabyte of storage and
the <A HREF="http://www.annoyances.org/win95/">Windows 95</A> operating system. At first I loathed Windows because
it hid the barely changed DOS 7 under the revamped GUI and it took 2 minutes to boot. After learning my way around
Windows, I began to enjoy the new OS, though it removed the need for the system tweaking that I enjoyed on the
old PS/1. With the addition of a CD-ROM, computers were becoming more and more interactive on a graphical level.
The look of programs began to take short term precedence over the long term import of structure and content. To
a point, this has been disappointing because of the abundance of slick graphics on what are poorly designed games
and web sites. It has also led to <A HREF="http://www.metacreations.com/">ingenious</A> user interface creations
that raise the bar for all software and web pages.</P>
<P>We then replaced the IBM with a flashy <A HREF="http://www.acer.com/">Acer</A> <A HREF="http://www.acer.com/aac/aspire/">Aspire</A>
on which my web page was created. I've since installed two RAM SIMMS and an additional 2 gig hard drive to this
system and upgraded to <A HREF="http://www.annoyances.org/win98/">Windows 98</A>. As it would seem, I have been
a diehard PC fan for quite some time. All that has changed this semester when I began using a <A HREF="http://www.apple.com/">Macintosh</A>
in both a graphics class with <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/">Adobe</A> Quark, <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/illustrator/main.html">Illustrator</A>,
and <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/photoshop/main.html">Photoshop</A>, and a video class with a <A HREF="http://www.media100.com/product/M100/M100Products.html">Media100</A>
at <A HREF="http://206.28.204.39/default.htm">Frederick Community College</A>.<BR>
<BR>
I decided to bypass the prerequisite introduction to the Macintosh, trusting my familiarity with computers in general
to get me through the class. While I don't know the intricacies of the Mac hardware as I do with a PC, I have been
able to pick up a few things and feel comfortable using one. In fact my next computer will most likely be a Mac.
I miss my 'right-click' but I love the OS and haven't failed to notice the growing similarity Windows is sharing
with the Mac.<BR>
<BR>
I have been online with this computer since <A HREF="http://w3.ag.uiuc.edu/AIM/2.0/index.html">Netscape 2.0</A>
was the standard and have watched the style and quality of hyper-text documents evolve into the high bandwidth,
java-laden pages popular today. The sites that keep me coming back are available on the links page. My prolonged
interest in computers of all kinds has kept me abreast of new developments. My computer literacy aides me in that
I am not a software specific user. Because of the similarity of interfaces with most programs, I've found that
learning new software comes quick and I enjoy discovering new things about and within specific applications. Leading
into the next narrative, I enter the art world through this intuitive use of computers.<BR>
<BR>
As a young(er) boy, my family often took day trips to interesting places. On one such trip, we drove to a family
friend's fathers house, which he had designed and built himself. Spiral staircases, organic structure, and unconventional
design in a house impressed me and I was enthraled with the novelty of the house. These elements were the inspiration
for me to become an architect and it stayed with me for nearly all of my public education. In eighth grade I was
introduced to computer aided drafting (CAD) and because of my computer experience, quickly excelled with the software.
While at the time I mainly used CAD to zoom in and leave dot sized messages to friends in the next class, the software
jump-started my interest in digital media's precision abilities for use in drafting. <BR>
<BR>
As a freshman in high school, again in a communications technology course, I drove ahead of fellow students in
the CAD section of the class and began work with three dimensions in <A HREF="http://www.autodesk.com/index.html">AutoDesk's</A>
<A HREF="http://www.autodesk.com/products/acad2000/index.htm">AutoCAD</A> R12. This excited me to enroll in architectural
drawing classes, taking drafting I and II in my sophomore and junior years. I learned (backwards) how to do on
paper what I much preferred doing on a monitor, gaining familiarity with standard drafting tools. Because the second
semester drawing class dealt predominantly with CAD, I was able to quickly show my abilities and took an interest
in AutoCAD's 3d rendering companion, <A HREF="http://ktx.com/">3DStudio</A>. <BR>
<BR>
In my senior year, my drafting professor asked that I take an independent study course under his supervision so
that I might learn and subsequently instruct him, how to use 3DStudio. The school had a copy of release 2 for DOS
at the time and I studied an instructional volume to grasp the basics. As an architecture major, I planned to import
my floor plan from the previous semester and loft it into a 3D model. This was the instructor's hopes, so that
students might get a better visualization of the floor plans that they designed through a virtual walk-through.
After realizing how simple it would be to merely import floor plans, I endeavored to create a more complex object.
<BR>
<BR>
Modeled after my dream guitar, the Parker Fly, I created a detailed 3D mesh through trial and error while learning
3DStudioR2. Midway through the semester, the school purchased release 4 of the software, allowing me to render
in higher resolutions. I worked on the <A HREF="Gallery/bigblue.jpg">guitar</A> for most of the semester, but I
also completed an instructional binder for use in future classes. <A HREF="http://www.linganore.org/">Linganore
High School</A> students wishing to experiment with 3DStudio can simply go through my tutorial and bypass the errors
I made.<BR>
<BR>
Because of my need to create my own textures within the modeling program, I began to experiment with more conventional
graphics programs. Now that my aim has strayed from architecture to 3D modeling, I realized that I had neglected
the artistic training necessary for the field. Since then I have taken a semester of modern art history and two
semesters of video production. While I have not had the time yet to take a drawing class, I feel that my sense
of composition and visualization is strong.<BR>
<BR>
As a long time reader of science fiction and speculative fiction, imaginative concepts in both art and technology
are no stranger to me. My interest in 3D artwork is not limited to modeling characters or objects in animation.
I have personally experienced an evolution in computing power that will only continue to grow into the future.
<BR>
<BR>
Because of the ever growing speed of processors and user's ever growing ambitions to utilize the systems to the
utmost, applications have progressed immensely in the relatively short time that I have been exposed to the world
of the digital. I have watched computer games grow from text based role playing games to the immersive reality
of <A HREF="http://www.idsoftware.com/">Id</A>'s <A HREF="http://www.cybernetic.co.uk/quake2.htm">Quake II</A>.
I recall at time when hyper-text documents on the world wide web were on the cutting edge because of now simple
structure formats like frames and animated graphics, apologizing if a text-only version was not available. Today
the world's leading sites, full of the latest advancements in the browser wars, direct the visitor to pages where
one can equip a browser with additional specialized software. The internet will continue to grow, removing the
populace's fear of computers and familiarizing people of all ages with what will soon be Earth's leading marketplace.
<BR>
<BR>
As the agility of the chip is boosted, the existing technologies involved in games like Quake and <A HREF="http://www.tombraider.com/tr3/">Tomb
Raider III</A> will combine with the online retail technology exemplified by successes like <A HREF="http://www.cdnow.com/">Cdnow.com</A>
and <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com</A>. Although this type of <A HREF="http://204.151.55.46/1989-94/pre88/b328653.htm">virtual
reality</A> is far too cost prohibitive now for the general public, the end is in sight. At this moment, television
broadcasters around the world are using computer generated <A HREF="http://www.videosystems.com/archives/901vs21.htm">sets</A>
for their news programs, cutting costs in half and adding heretofore impossible design options. The government
is training pilots in simulators using 3D technology, and the marines have considered using <A HREF="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/5.04/ff_doom.html?pg=1&topic=">customized</A>
versions of Doom II for combat training. Firms are showing investors motion video of completed structure years
before ground is broken. The fact that these big spenders can afford this technology in the present suggests that
in the not so distant future, as processing speed catches up to our needs, virtual reality will find a place in
every day society. <BR>
<BR>
The possibility that I might be contributing to this new enterprise excites my imagination. What does the future
hold for the gradually merging worlds of television and the internet? What will be the product when virtual reality
is added to the mix? This is why I have taken courses concerning video production. This is why I strive to learn
graphical software applications in both 2D, 3D, and non-linear video editing. Perhaps the interior decorators,
landscapers, and abstract sculptors of the world will be in the drivers seat when this technology comes to pass.
Even so, they will need people like me to make their dreams a virtual reality.</P>
