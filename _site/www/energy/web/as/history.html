Online gaming has come a long way in recent times.  Beginning with Doom II, dial up games were a popular means of competing, and competitions were formed to find the best of the best, and to show that computer gaming could be in the future a real competitive sport.  With the introduction of games such as Half Life, Starsiege Tribes, Unreal Tournament, and Quake III Arena, online gaming has hit a high never before seen.  These games placed the multiplayer experience before the single player for the first time ever, and the payoff has been huge.  Specialized teams of players, called clans, have hit a boom period thanks to this recent development in computer games.

The focus of Acid*SuN is Quake 3 Arena, one of the most anticipated games ever, thanks to the immense popularity of Quake 1 and 2.  Utilizing state of the art technology, it is far more engrossing and intense than previous games of the FPS (first person shooter) genre.  While there are several forms of competition in Quake 3, Acid*SuN has chosen to concentrate on TDM (team death-match), in which two teams of four attempt to control a map and win by attaining the most frags, or kills.

Soon afterwards, Evan Kucera, Aaron Shook, and Todd Jarret, followed by Robert (?)  The newest member is Doug Anthony Hare, bringing the grand total to 9 members.
