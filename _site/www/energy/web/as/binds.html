Abbreviations to use when typing:
<BR><BR>
rl = rocket launcher
ra=red armor
<BR><BR>
ya=yellow armor
<BR><BR> 
rail=rail gun
<BR><BR>
mh=mega health
<BR><BR>
pl=plasma gun
<BR><BR>
ss=super shotgun
<BR><BR>
gl=grenade launcher
<BR><BR>
for example when guarding the ra in q3dm6: me gl you ss<BR>
(I’ll take grenade launcher and you the super shotgun)..<BR><BR>
Keep those messages that aren’t covered by binds very short.
Enemies at rl
Instead of: holy shit guys, they are camping the rocket launcher! 
<BR><BR>
Position -  see demo:
<BR><BR>
-	One team member will in all rooms guard p1 (position 1), another all p2’s etc.<BR>
-	If you i.e. are in the hallway between the quad and the ra in q3dm7 and an enemy shows up, and your team is defending quad, 
then don’t carry out the fight in the hallway à retreat into the quad room, where your team mates will help you (unless he is seriously 
wounded already - then finish him off of course)<BR>
- Look at what your teammates say: If they say need health and you can see by the bracket behind their name that they are in the rl
room, then if you are in the ra room, then say "Acid*Stereotype (red armor): health/armor available."
