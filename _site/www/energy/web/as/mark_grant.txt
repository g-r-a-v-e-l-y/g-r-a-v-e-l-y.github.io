<Stereotype> hello?
<Stereotype> why do you take away my ops? I'm more in this channel than you are, and you know I'm trustworthy. It is common for non-clan membvers to get ops in channels...you should be glad I have ops as I', the only one in irc who hangs out here all day and night ;)
<Stereotype> you there?
<acid|grantastic> yeah
<acid|grantastic> i'm here
<acid|grantastic> mark: i took away your ops to get your attention
<Stereotype> why?
<acid|grantastic> no, you arent' in the channel more than I am.. maybe only on weekends..but that's all
<Stereotype> what do you mean?
<acid|grantastic> because I wanted to know why you were still on admin?
<Stereotype> bah
<Stereotype> not true
<Stereotype> I'm here every day until 4 am
<Stereotype> you are not :)
<Stereotype> who cares
<Stereotype> give me back my ops and turn the moderation off
<Stereotype> please :)
<acid|grantastic> ok, pt 2: i dont' care if you are here 24/7, you are no longer in acid*sun and I dont' think you need to be an admin in this channel anymore
<Stereotype> besides what do you mean by get my attention?
<Stereotype> bah
<Stereotype> true
<acid|grantastic> i've been messaging you, noticing you etc for the past hour
<Stereotype> I was getting food
<acid|grantastic> oh
<acid|grantastic> so why do you still have admin?
<Stereotype> I dunno
<acid|grantastic> why did you get removed ?
<Stereotype> removed from where?
<acid|grantastic> sorry - did should equal didn't
<Stereotype> what do I know
<acid|grantastic> typo
<Stereotype> oh
<Stereotype> Because I didn't...I don't kniw
<Stereotype> I can get myself removed eventually
<Stereotype> I'm not sure
<Stereotype> I can try
<Stereotype> but I think I do deserve opps :)
<acid|grantastic> ok
<Stereotype> I mean why not?
<acid|grantastic> I'm just doing house cleaning
<acid|grantastic> opps?
<Stereotype> yes
<acid|grantastic> ops are for clan members
<acid|grantastic> voice, you do deserv
<acid|grantastic> e
<Stereotype> bs
<acid|grantastic> you will get voice mark
<Stereotype> ops are for people that are trustworthy
<Stereotype> bahhhhhhh
<Stereotype> I disagree
<acid|grantastic> _until the clan is back up to a few more members, nate and I _are_ acid*sun
<Stereotype> but that's up to you
<acid|grantastic> well i'm sorry that you disagree
<Stereotype> I know
<acid|grantastic> but that's the way it is
<Stereotype> I'm just saying that you don't pay much attenetion usually and I had to give voices last night as every night because I'm the only op around ;)
<Stereotype> but ok
<Stereotype> who cares
<acid|grantastic> mark:
<acid|grantastic> if the channel isn't moderated
<acid|grantastic> there's no reason for anyone to have voices
<Stereotype> yes there is
<acid|grantastic> what's that?
<Stereotype> it's a sign of curtousy
<Stereotype> you can't have people with voices and people without unless you are trying to tell them that they are of less importance
<Stereotype> it is VERY important
<Stereotype> I'm sorry you don't see that
<Stereotype> go to any randomn channel and you'll see what I am talking about
<acid|grantastic> I understand that it is a sign of courtesy
<Stereotype> yes
<acid|grantastic> but I look at it as a sign, from the ops
<acid|grantastic> so when only chanserv is around.. 
<acid|grantastic> it won't be a big deal
<acid|grantastic> the ops are Nate and I
<acid|grantastic> if we aren't around to give the voice, how can it be seen as insulting?
<Stereotype> the thing is that you are beeing stupid that's all and seem to want to prove something here
<Stereotype> just forget it
<acid|grantastic> ?
<acid|grantastic> what are you talking about?
<Stereotype> you seem to caught up with all this bs
<acid|grantastic> wtf are you talking about?
<acid|grantastic> i would just like you off our admin
<acid|grantastic> i couldn't get your attention
<acid|grantastic> so i tried a number of things to do so
<acid|grantastic> it seems taht de-voicing you and moderating the channel worked
<Stereotype> what I am talking about is that it is perfectly ok to have a non member as opps so that he can watch the channel in your interest
<acid|grantastic> ste: i agree with that _concept_ 
<Stereotype> because a channel should have ops in the channel
<acid|grantastic> but - I dont' want _you_ to be taht op, no offense..
<Stereotype> and with you and Nate quitting every day at around 11 it would be good to have opps around...uie. me
<acid|grantastic> with all due respect, you are no longer a member of acid*sun
<Stereotype> whom you know and should trust
<Stereotype> I know
<Stereotype> so what?
<acid|grantastic> so what?
<acid|grantastic> what do you mean so what?
<Stereotype> who cares?
<acid|grantastic> mark: are you listening at all? Nate and I care.. Nate and I are acid*sun at the momet,... nate and I will run acid*sun, and it's IRC channel as we damned well please.. acid*sun is _our_ clan now.. 
<Stereotype> so what if i;m not in acid* ... you can't possibly find anyone better suited to have opps in here as I don't do shit don't abuse it am always around cause no threat to you know the people
<Stereotype> but you seem mad at me for leaving you, so I'll give you the pleasure of playing the brainless ass for a while :)
<Stereotype> bye
<Stereotype> now let it be '
<Stereotype> it's ok
<acid|grantastic> who the fuck do you think you are?
<Stereotype> Mark
<Stereotype> watching the channel
<Stereotype> beeing interested and I care
<Stereotype> so what
<Stereotype> listen I don't want to go overboard but I simply think you lack an objective view in this discussion
<Stereotype> I went a little overboard - I'm sorry
<Stereotype> I accept your dission and now forget that we had this debate
<acid|grantastic> i believe taht neither one of us is capable of making an objective opionion
<acid|grantastic> i think objective opinions have no place in a decision of this nature
<Stereotype> thing is that I think it would be in the interest of the cghannel to have me as an opp and you seem to base your arguments on personal issues
<Stereotype> that;s ok
<Stereotype> you're dissapointed and angry at me...fine...I understand you...I would act the same way as you do now....NOT
<acid|grantastic> what?
<acid|grantastic> did you just say "not?"
<acid|grantastic> did you just "wanye's world" me?
<acid|grantastic> are you in the 7th grade?
<Stereotype> if you would drop out i would still give you ops as I know and trust you
<Stereotype> you: Mark the ass is out and now ket's all let him know it
<acid|grantastic> well i'm sorry i dont' feel the way you want me to feel but that's how it is
<acid|grantastic> in fact, most eveyone feels that way about you - in TS and the acid*sun lurkers
<acid|grantastic> it wasn't a problem that you left
<Stereotype> and I say leave it there...I think you are acting silly ... but I understand how one could be tempted to act in a situation like this, so I'm not angry at you
<Stereotype> just let it be
<acid|grantastic> it was taht you left to be in a "better" clan, then came back with SMS in your name saying that they were such "great guys"
<acid|grantastic> don't you see that that insinuates that we are "not" great guys?
<Stereotype> well I'm sorry that that get's you upset
<Stereotype> the thing is that youall take this personally
<acid|grantastic> mark, quit patronizing me
<acid|grantastic> EVERYONE saw that as EXTREMELY FUCKING RUDE
<acid|grantastic> i'm not the only one
<Stereotype> yes: I wanted to be in a "better" clan and will be now
<acid|grantastic> taht's why riff was talking to you
<Stereotype> but you just seem to think that this is personal and it's not
<Stereotype> you can't accept that yet
<Stereotype> ok
<acid|grantastic> it wasn't
<acid|grantastic> but it is now
<Stereotype> You'll get over that fact
<acid|grantastic> quit fucking telling me what i acept and what i'll do
<acid|grantastic> jeezus you are a pompous asshole sometimes - do you have no sense of empathy? fuck
<Stereotype> I'm just provoking you
<Stereotype> relax
<acid|grantastic> provoking me?
<acid|grantastic> what kind of asshole thing to do is that?
<Stereotype> I'm upset because you (whom I considder as much a friend as I would anyone in life) think that now that I left the clan you have to give up everything we had as buddies and that is just LAME
<acid|grantastic> NO
<acid|grantastic> not true
<Stereotype> I'm mad at you ok?
<Stereotype> that's not fucking hard to understand
<Stereotype> sure it is
<acid|grantastic> yes, it's ok for you to feel however you want to feel
<acid|grantastic> i don't fel that we can no longer talk jusst because you have left the clan
<Stereotype> well you are acting as if we never knew each other and that is bs
<acid|grantastic> i only slightly betrayed, for obvious reasons that i shouldn't have to go into
<acid|grantastic> and all i approached you for today is to get your ip off of the admin list
<Stereotype> you should trust me enough to give me ops, not because I am "suited" for it but because you trust me as a friend
<acid|grantastic> but mark, I'm sorry to say, I _don't_ trust you like that anymore :/ i did at one time, but unfortunately.. at this moment, I can't say taht I do
<acid|grantastic> and even if you dont' understand why
<acid|grantastic> (i'm not even sure that I do)
<Stereotype> and the fact that you show no interest at all to grant me any kind of role I think is rude and respectless and certainly everything but "friendly"
<acid|grantastic> you should accept taht
<Stereotype> why?
<Stereotype> why Ileft acid*?
<Stereotype> you still don't get it?
<acid|grantastic> i don't care
<acid|grantastic> anymore
<acid|grantastic> why you left acid
<Stereotype> fine
<Stereotype> ok
<Stereotype> It should be clear anyways and ... you do care ... don't give me that "it's no big deal" bs
<Stereotype> it's a huge deal
<Stereotype> I left and now Robert, Evan,Doug are gone too
<Stereotype> Todd is out
<Stereotype> Aaron doesn;'t give a fuck about the clan
<acid|grantastic> robert evan and doug followed you didn't they?
<Stereotype> and Dimi is never around and....welll sux
<Stereotype> Nate is on a modem
<acid|grantastic> you have aaron and todd backwards btw
<Stereotype> it is a BIG deal so don't bs me with "everything is fine"
<Stereotype> no
<acid|grantastic> what si the "real big deal"?
<Stereotype> evan might join if i join sms
<Stereotype> rbert is clanless
<Stereotype> the big deal: acid*sun has to start all over because I left the clan
<Stereotype> and I'm sorry
<acid|grantastic> ?
<acid|grantastic> that's part of waht pisses me off
<acid|grantastic> acid*sun is starting all over again because of a number of things
<Stereotype> well I didn't want this all to happen
<Stereotype> I know
<acid|grantastic> your leaving was only the final spark
<Stereotype> I know
<acid|grantastic> everyone was leaving anyway
<Stereotype> I know
<acid|grantastic> and I dont' think it's all that bad anyway - i can recruit, i can find more players
<Stereotype> that is why I can't understand why everyone is like " why did you leave? "
<Stereotype> it's fucking obvuious
<Stereotype> because I didn't want to start all over
<acid|grantastic> it's not that hard
<Stereotype> I think it's great that you two have the energy to do so
<Stereotype> YES IT IS HARD
<Stereotype> it's was ALWAYS hard
<Stereotype> i took time
<Stereotype> it was frustrating
<Stereotype> it was my fucking life you asshole
<Stereotype> it was hard
<Stereotype> and I put a lot of sleepless hours into acid
<Stereotype> I cared
<Stereotype> you were my friends
<Stereotype> and everytime there was an argument I got so upset
<Stereotype> i almost cried the first time todd left
<Stereotype> because i knew it was my fault
<Stereotype> and I'm clos4 to tears now too
<acid|grantastic> :/
<Stereotype> and you guys are telling me you don't give a shit
<Stereotype> youi don't trsut me]
<Stereotype> bla bla bla
<Stereotype> fuck this man
<Stereotype> this is simply wrong
<Stereotype> this is not what i wanted
<Stereotype> I loved acid*sun
<Stereotype> I was proud of it
<Stereotype> but it was falling apart
<Stereotype> and noone gave a shit it seemed
<Stereotype> bnesides you and nate
<Stereotype> I was tired man
<Stereotype> gtewmn[k
* Stereotype crying
<acid|grantastic> look man, I see what you are saying, but I think it makes sense somewhat why we have some animosity toward you
<acid|grantastic> :(
<Stereotype> can't believcei'm crying
<Stereotype> damn this is stupi\d
<Stereotype> damn this is stupi\d
<acid|grantastic> i agree - it is stupid
<Stereotype> fuck man
<Stereotype> i don't want this
<acid|grantastic> i can see why you left the clan - i always have been able to  
<Stereotype> you guys are my friends man
<acid|grantastic> but I also took offense at seeing you come back in with SMS on your name...
<acid|grantastic> it was like betrayal
<Stereotype> I understand
<acid|grantastic> that sense of betrayal pissed me off, but it pissed nate off even more
<acid|grantastic> as you know, i'm sure
<Stereotype> yes
<acid|grantastic> i have no problem with you in the channel
<Stereotype> I wished you would see how difficult all this is for me
<acid|grantastic> I do see - it's a tightrope you are on
<Stereotype> I just wanted to compete in the big leagues and that took so much control over me that I forgot about acid* for a few days
<acid|grantastic> well, i _knew_ that all along mark
<acid|grantastic> 1,8=]
<acid|grantastic> but _i'm_ not in a clan for thqt
<Stereotype> I wanted both
<acid|grantastic> i'm in a clan to hang with nice guys, just about regardless of how good they are
<Stereotype> and I wasn't able to decide which one was more important
<acid|grantastic> i know
<Stereotype> I was jeleous at all the big players
<Stereotype> I wanted to be there too
<Stereotype> I was sick and tired of getting laughed at
<Stereotype> I wanted to be a respected player and in a respected caln so much that i just left
<Stereotype> maybe it was wrong...but that is the decision I made
<acid|grantastic> I understand
<acid|grantastic> I dont' agree fully, but I do understand
<Stereotype> and I didn't see any possibility that acid* would ever belong to it
<acid|grantastic> and it's inthe past, which is as you know, unchangable
<acid|grantastic> I believe we will belong to that ranking - but not for skills
<Stereotype> "and it's inthe past, which is as you know, unchangable"<---don't get the full meaning of that
<acid|grantastic> I think we may end up earning a name for ourselves either way
<acid|grantastic> what I meant by that is that you can't woe the past - it wasn't intended to mean that you can never come back
<acid|grantastic> sorry
<acid|grantastic> bad phrasing
<Stereotype> what are you saying? and it's inthe past, which is as you know, unchangable<---what is in the past?
<Stereotype> sorry for beeing stupid right now
<acid|grantastic> your decision to leave acid*sun to move on
<Stereotype> ic
<Stereotype> I'm not joining any fucking clan
<acid|grantastic> ?
<Stereotype> I give up
<acid|grantastic> join sms 
<Stereotype> I'll take the summer off
<acid|grantastic> or find someone better
<Stereotype> I don't even want to join sms
<Stereotype> I'm NOT GOOD ENOUGH
<Stereotype> i'm silly
<Stereotype> thinking I was ready
<acid|grantastic> you _are_ good enough
<Stereotype> I'll be Mark until end of september
<acid|grantastic> fucking christ
<Stereotype> no you don't understand
<Stereotype> SMS ... 1337 clans is not what I want
<Stereotype> I don't know what i want
<Stereotype> I WANTED us to be a "1337" clan
<Stereotype> and that was silly
<Stereotype> wasn't enough time
<Stereotype> we needed time and I gave up
<Stereotype> and now I will be gone for the summer anyways
<Stereotype> so there is NO use in joining a clan
<acid|grantastic> agreed - 1337 clans consist of players that have ben FPS'ing since doom or q1 at least (for the most part)
<acid|grantastic> mark, you are wrong
<Stereotype> SSSSSSSIIIIIIIILLLLLLLLLLLYYYYYYYYY
<acid|grantastic> here's why I joined acid*sun
<acid|grantastic> in the first place
<acid|grantastic> I met you
<acid|grantastic> you seemed cool
<acid|grantastic> i had nothing better to do
<acid|grantastic> i met the rest of the gang
<acid|grantastic> they too seemed cool
<acid|grantastic> so I accepted your offer
<acid|grantastic> before that I had always thought "clannies' were dorky
<acid|grantastic> hehe
<acid|grantastic> now that I'm in one
<acid|grantastic> I find taht I love the comradary
<Stereotype> me too
<acid|grantastic> it has become the _only_ reason that i'm in the clan
<acid|grantastic> becuase I too get very very aggravated with my quake skills, as you know
<acid|grantastic> but I NEVER get aggravated with any clan members (of acid*sun)
<acid|grantastic> a clan is a good place to find a game
<acid|grantastic> if you are into TDM, it's a good place to play that
<acid|grantastic> I'm not especially interested in TDM
<acid|grantastic> you are
<acid|grantastic> so if you wold like to find another clan that is more into TDM, I completely understand and empathise with you
<acid|grantastic> i dont' take offense at it
<Stereotype> i never did either really...I was allways proud of every improvment I saw....I hated every second of loosing but in the end was always proud and happy that one of my friends had the skill to win and was getting better
<Stereotype> I just didn't have the patience
<Stereotype> I saw all the other clans
<acid|grantastic> go - acheive your goal - i told you that when you first told me your decision to leave
<acid|grantastic> ^^ that is, if your goal is to be on a skilld TDm team
<acid|grantastic> mine isn't
<Stereotype> winning beeing admired ... having full channels
<acid|grantastic> exactly
<Stereotype> but that is not what I really want
<acid|grantastic> i _hate_ losing - especially to you - as my mouse knows damned well
<Stereotype> i don't want to "join"
<Stereotype> I wanted us to be that
<Stereotype> and that is still all i want
<Stereotype> I was frustrated
<Stereotype> I still am
<Stereotype> I was sick and tired of Todd and Aaron and DOug'
<acid|grantastic> understandable
<acid|grantastic> they gave acid*sun a very very bad name
<Stereotype> they never understood what the clan was about]
<Stereotype> we were a clan of 4 oplayers
<acid|grantastic> bad enought that I stopped going by acid|ph8, as I'm sure you noticed
<acid|grantastic> yes, we were
<Stereotype> you, nate, evan abnd myself
<Stereotype> I love robert but even for him he wasn't around
<Stereotype> I'm soooo tired Grant
<Stereotype> I wanted us to be serious
<Stereotype> to "love" the clan
<Stereotype> to be proud of it and be honoured to be a part of it
<Stereotype> I wanted us to work harder
<acid|grantastic> I think, while hindsite is always 20/20, it would have been easier we had all talked about this befor eyou decided to leave  - it would have been easier for us to remain acid*sun and for us to start recruiting again - as hard as it would have been to kick doug and robert (if we were to do that0
<acid|grantastic> yeah.. i know what you mean
<acid|grantastic> but it wasn't happening :/ unfortunately
<acid|grantastic> it may yet though
<acid|grantastic> your leaveing has odly "scared off" the others
<acid|grantastic> acid*sun, minus yourself and evan, is down to the barest of bones right now
<acid|grantastic> we can begin recruiting anew
<acid|grantastic> remember the quote taht I made a few nights ago that you asked me about?
<Stereotype> god...Grant could we do it again? Do you think we could make it better? If you promise me that we'll try harder I'll promise you to try out for acid* again and even be a trainee, if you were to take me
<acid|grantastic> "it's only after have you lost everything that you are free to do anything"
<acid|grantastic> we can do whatever we want now
<acid|grantastic> mark - i honestly have very little interest in practicing harder at becoming a better TDm team :/
<acid|grantastic> nate may
<acid|grantastic> and I wouldn't want to make you a trainee - that is belittling and we already know you too well for taht
<acid|grantastic> I'd certainly like it if you, nate, evan and I were to sit in a private channel and discuss all of this
<Stereotype> what i mean is that we become a real clan with motivation, with dedication, with code, with a webpage ( :) ) and that practices
<acid|grantastic> yes
<acid|grantastic> that's why I stuck around and didn't join TS - they already had all of these things and I think, subconciously, Nate and I had this grudge to prove to you that we could too
<Stereotype> i want both to become better as a team...not to the extent I thought I wanted, but I want us to be more than buddies that hang out
<acid|grantastic> this is why I have long appreciated TS's recruitment policy
<acid|grantastic> by their method, it is next to impossible to get a doug or a robert in the clan
<Stereotype> I want to be proud of us as friends that have a code and comradery in addition to becomming better as a team
<acid|grantastic> or a todd or an aaron for that matter
<acid|grantastic> i understand that mark, and I feel the same way - i htink it's perfectly possible, although I do feel that we are starting from the bare bones up - 
<Stereotype> TS is great I agree
<acid|grantastic> if we were to do that , we would be a four man team, recruiting again
<acid|grantastic> no offense to robert but he is wellcome to try out
<Stereotype> but I want us to be like TS but more serious in gaming
<acid|grantastic> but unless he starts hanging out more in irc, w
<Stereotype> they are so scared that they even never play
<acid|grantastic> he'll never make it past recruit
<acid|grantastic> i know what you mean
<acid|grantastic> one thing about them
<Stereotype> the only games they play are scrimms against their buddies and that is not what I want
<acid|grantastic> is taht i've _never_ heard them talk start
<acid|grantastic> strat even, in their channel
<acid|grantastic> but what you ahve to understand about them is that they have different goals than you
<Stereotype> I know
<acid|grantastic> they aren't out to be the number one tdm or ctf team
<acid|grantastic> theya re out to have a great time playing q3a - which is essentially  all i'm in it for
<Stereotype> I want both in our team:1) code and friendship as a real team 2) to practice and put our code to work in games
<acid|grantastic> i just think that being on a great clan, with great teamates, and with possible great teamply as an added bonus
<Stereotype> which means1) spending time with each other 2) practacing
<acid|grantastic> yup
<acid|grantastic> and yup
<acid|grantastic> I think spending time with eachother in irc or whatever is essential - and of course i can remeber the _HUGE_ improvements we made during the very beginning
<Stereotype> theya re out to have a great time playing q3a - which is essentially all i'm in it for <---- me too, but a great part of having fun with a game is to become better
<Stereotype> my heart beats for TDM so that is what we would have to work on as well
<acid|grantastic> hehe
<Stereotype> 1on1's are nice but get us nowhere as a team
<acid|grantastic> I understand 
<acid|grantastic> but it won't be until september taht we can have regular practices of that sort :/
<Stereotype> and unless there is no fire and team spirit there is no sense to beeing in a clan for q3 TDM...I mean then we might as well open up a mens club oin some random irc server
<Stereotype> i know
<acid|grantastic> lol
<acid|grantastic> i know what you mean about the mens club
<acid|grantastic> i originally wanted to simply do a "quake club" after you left because it soured me on the notion of teamplay
<acid|grantastic> but i do think it could work again
<acid|grantastic> there have to be the right people out there somewhere
<Stereotype> of course
<Stereotype> we would have 4 players
<acid|grantastic> _somewhere_ there is some nice guy that feels like we do, with a cable modem and no clan affiliation
<Stereotype> that is more than most clans have
<acid|grantastic> ha
<acid|grantastic> true that
<Stereotype> well there must be
<Stereotype> look at ts
<acid|grantastic> yup
<Stereotype> people loved the idea of ts
<acid|grantastic> (although I wouldn't have let rigor into acid*sun if it were up to me)
<Stereotype> and they tried out for them and not for GDL ie.
<Stereotype> ha
<Stereotype> I don't know him really
<acid|grantastic> what do you mean, for then and not GDL?
<acid|grantastic> what's GDL?
<acid|grantastic> 1,8=]
<Stereotype> a mass recruiting military puberty co.
<Stereotype> they have 30 people and dont even talk to each other
<acid|grantastic> ha
<acid|grantastic> lol
<acid|grantastic> sounds like fun
<Stereotype> a clan without irc is for me no clan, most of them don't even know each other
<acid|grantastic> yup
<Stereotype> irc or something similar
<Stereotype> so...
<Stereotype> now what?
<acid|grantastic> lol
<acid|grantastic> i have no idea
<acid|grantastic> hehe
<Stereotype> We a team of 3 (hopefully 4) who want to start over again
<Stereotype> a little bit wiser
<acid|grantastic> lol
<acid|grantastic> yup
<acid|grantastic> it won't be impossible
<acid|grantastic> i'll talk to nate of course
<Stereotype> I agree
<acid|grantastic> but it's a shoe in
<acid|grantastic> it'll happen
<Stereotype> let him read our conversation
<acid|grantastic> 'i will
<acid|grantastic> polaris has logged it
<Stereotype> put it on the web if you want
<acid|grantastic> ha
<Stereotype> i want the world to know that I want to be a part of acid* again and am proud of it
<Stereotype> besides, this conversation has a lot of what we are were and want to be in it
<acid|grantastic> it would certainly look like a nice "code" - the two of us arguing about what we want in a clan - spawning the newly board acid sun
<acid|grantastic> yup
<acid|grantastic> you are putting a smile on my face man
<acid|grantastic> 1,8=]
<Stereotype> my tears have dried :)
<acid|grantastic> <grin>
<Stereotype> i really did cry
<Stereotype> god :)
<acid|grantastic> what a week eh?
<acid|grantastic> a long week
<Stereotype> yeah
<Stereotype> no shit
<Stereotype> well....I think you should talk to nate
<Stereotype> and i will talk to evan
<Stereotype> sound good?
<acid|grantastic> i will - as soon as I see him
<acid|grantastic> yes
<acid|grantastic> thanks for having this conversation with my
<Stereotype> ok
<acid|grantastic> me even
<Stereotype> thx for beeing a friend Grant
<acid|grantastic> thank you ;)
<acid|grantastic> you are auto voiced
<acid|grantastic> i'll talk to nate
<Stereotype> we'll make it somehow
<acid|grantastic> yes we will
<Stereotype> k
<acid|grantastic> we may end up making _everyone_ a recruit.. it's an idea i'm tossing around
<Stereotype> I'll keep an eye out for Evan
<acid|grantastic> ok
<Stereotype> what do you mean?
<acid|grantastic> while we are looking for member - i'm considering starting the entire clan at "recruit" or "newbie" status
<acid|grantastic> since this is an essentially new clan
<Stereotype> new name?
<acid|grantastic> after a month of active duty/service, you get your tag ;)
<Stereotype> I mean why not start all over?
<acid|grantastic> (this applies to all of us)
<acid|grantastic> you mean with a new clan naem alltogether?
<acid|grantastic> I've considered that
<acid|grantastic> but dont' know if I like the idea
<Stereotype> why not start a new clan?
<acid|grantastic> so much artwork (lol)
<Stereotype> hm true
<acid|grantastic> hehe
<Stereotype> new colors?
<acid|grantastic> plus i like the notion of a "reborn" acid*sun
<acid|grantastic> yes, new colors, and perhaps a new way of writing int
<acid|grantastic> i used [A*S] today in game
<Stereotype> yeah I guess so....reminds us of what we went throughj
<acid|grantastic> thought it was pretty cheeky
<Stereotype> nice
<Stereotype> yeah it is
<Stereotype> I like it
<acid|grantastic> very much so - a rebord acid*sun will be the pheonix of q3 clans ;)
<Stereotype> ha
<acid|grantastic> having passed through the flames of turmoil
<acid|grantastic> lol
<Stereotype> but I think it would be nice for the 4 of us to wear the tag...I mean look at it this way: we've been recruits for 4-5 months now
<acid|grantastic> lol
<acid|grantastic> true that
<Stereotype> I want to wear our tag with pride
<acid|grantastic> hehe
<Stereotype> i will be gone
<acid|grantastic> so what is it do you think?
<Stereotype> as long as I can still play I want to wear our tag
<Stereotype> [A*S] is gravy
<acid|grantastic> well, I'd need to talk to nate - you know - but i understand
<acid|grantastic> hehe
<acid|grantastic> i also like:
<acid|grantastic> aS.
<Stereotype> sure
<acid|grantastic> or As.
<Stereotype> i like the * so much:)
<Stereotype> it's what makes our name different from all the other tags
<acid|grantastic> although A*S is cool because it looks like ASS blanked out for censoring or whatever 
<acid|grantastic> hehe
<acid|grantastic> yup
<acid|grantastic> that's true
<acid|grantastic> 4*5
<acid|grantastic> (no - not that one)
<acid|grantastic> hehe
<Stereotype> too 1337
<acid|grantastic> yup
<acid|grantastic> a*s
<acid|grantastic> I've always liked the lowercase-ness
<Stereotype> if everyth9ing works out and Nate agrees to take me onboard again, i will look for a new name
<Stereotype> yeah
<acid|grantastic> hehe - ok
<acid|grantastic> you mean besided stereotype?
<acid|grantastic> I think I will begin using my alternate name as well - "adhaya"
<Stereotype> no imean instead of stereotype
<acid|grantastic> yeah
<acid|grantastic> that's what I meant - sorry
<Stereotype> yes
<Stereotype> I want to be reborn :)
<acid|grantastic> a*s|adhays
<acid|grantastic> a*s|adhaya
