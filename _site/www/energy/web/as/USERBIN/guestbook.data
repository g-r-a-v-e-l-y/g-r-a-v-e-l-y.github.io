I'm not at home right now, but tommorow when i get home i hope to set this bad boy up so that it's not so ugly :P  In theory, i should be able to pass messages to the script so that when you click on the "messageboard" link, it goes straight to it, instead of the "post a message" thingy... hrmmm  Anyway, this is a bs post to see if I can post a message from a remote machine (all the previous posts are from the server machine)  :P

As I sit here at about 3 in the morning on the verge of taking my computer apart I wanted to say a couple of things to you all.  



Grant:  Thanks for your work more than anything else.  It is because of you that we have this sweet website with a _white_ quasi corduroy background.  Also: get a new mouse man!  and when you get it make sure to respect it.  That wont be so hard since Mark will be gone for three months :)  Use this time to learn to treat your mouse like a beautiful woman that should be cherished, not beaten on the desk when you get fragged!  Thanks for the great games Grant, keep the hobart alive!  Thank you for keeping AS alive for that short time.



Nate:  You are the man.  er should I say ewok  :)  I will understand the pain of a modem within a day so we can bitch about it together :) like i dont bitch about my connection enough the way it is.  Thanks for teaching me how to rocket jump back in the day when I was a newbie, it changed my game.  Again I thank you and grant for keeping the group going.  Soon we will play again, until then i will be playing bots as Im sure you know already  :)



Mark:  I will never forget my first impression of you kicking my ass on dm17 when I tried out back at the beginning of the year.  Thanks to you and the rest I am able to keep up (sometimes).  I venture to say that you out of all of us has spent the most time working to make this a functioning group, without you I wouldnt be writing this message or would i have such a great group of friends.  Good luck in Europe and Ill be checking my mail for some 1337 postcards  :)  Take care man, I look forward to seeing you again soon.



Robert:  We did have some sweet games on 215.15, and I am so incredibly happy that you checked us out.  It will be some time before i get back on this shitty network again to play on 215.15, so when i come back you will probably school me again :)  Thanks for the great games, and make sure to keep playing over the summer.  Im going to have to have someone to teach me how to play this game again, and I figure it will be you.



John:  Welcome to the group, I think you make a fine addition to acid and Im not the only one who thinks that.  Keep up your skills on dm17, I know you have them; in fact Im afraid for what your going to do to me when i come back after being quakeless for 3 months :)  Stick around eventhough not much is going to be happening this summer, because come this fall the fun will begin!



Thanks for everything guys!

EVAN :P  thanks for the lovely post and trust me, you will be missed just as much as nate already is. I'm already freaking out about everyone being gone this summer. The "original gang" of mark, evan, nate, myself, and dimi, has slowly dwindled down to only just one person with a constant connection - myself. With our great new members and not so new (robert ;) ) I will probably have more than enough "stuff" to worry about :P

this messageboard will soon be replaced by a variant of what's on quakeworld, or by a variant ot the UBB.. we shall see. 

What's I'd really like to do is poll acid*sun members as to _what_ they'd like to see in a homepage. The current structure functions primarily as a url.. that's it. It's useless. What features/usability would motivate you, the user to replace your default homepage with this site?

I need to be able to prioritize these things so that i can get to work on them. - is flash navigation more important than a demo's section? Is the members section more important than the news/headlines? 

Another issue i'm looking into is "user contributions" - i'd like to be able to allow anyone to post demo's - from both as clan TDM's or from interesting acid*sun tourney matches. the same is true of the news section and the messageboards (obviously on the Mb's)

anyone is welcome to post constructive ideas/concepts here or contact me through email (lstave1@home.com) or IM - gstavelyg - I'll try to keep a running list. For all intensive purposes, this current design - including the look/feel of the wallpaper image, is dead.

It no longer applies to acid*sun's motivation and goals as a team and doesn't give any hint as to "what we are all about"



Thanks for any contributions - let's make this site a success!



In a side not, Vladimir (as|bullet|rec) has offered to mirror the site in ontario - thanks Vlad!

Hey guys,

I'm in London now, so I'll finally be on IRC now :)

Great to be in the online world and with you guys again.
...looking forward to some nice chats again with my buddies.

Right now, I find a running news section and members section 
most important. IMHO a demo section can wait. Flash 
navigation would rule of course :)

Grant we'll chat about this anyways :) ... wonderful to see 
that things are happening here.

Hello mark. welcome back to the www. I too would primarily like to focus on a news and members section - a better, threaded messageboard is a long stride toward achieving that.

I realise that some of you have a fetish for Flash navigation. Know anyone that knows the software well enough to make anything more than a "flash intro"? (gag) - i'm a big nut for functionality and purpose... Flash can be nice when worked into part of an interesting UI, but nine times out of ten, it makes for an overly complex UI. We will only probably have 5 or so "directions" a visitor can travel - why flash? Because it "looks slick" i guess... I can't think of _any_ sites that I visit on a daily basis that use a flash interface. And while I have seen some nice flash designs, I can't think of too many that I would want to have to navigate every day to browse a site. :P

Enough anti-flash ranting from me. It's great stuff.. it's a plugin, but most people in our "target audience" (if there is such a thing) will have the software and the bandwidth to not be annoyed by it. 

Concerning the "members" and "news" sections... everyone wants one. That's nothing new. In what format should we create it? Daily news updated on the frontpage? News on a seperate "headlines page" - I can think of a few ways to do it, including visitor posted headlines and news - that could be very interesting and allow for more a "portal" feel, which is what everyone likes anyway. Members? What to say? Pictures? Stats? I'm thinking something to do with a map of north america with pins in it... 



either way - a navigation scheme has to be determined to present all of this information in, as every designer focuses to create, the most easily navigable process possible. I'd like to discuss this further of course. And contrary to popular belief, I can be open minded about these things :P



Nice to hear from you mark - a few other members have mentioned ideas to me and I would now remind them to click the "post here" link at the top of this page and let me know here, in a more permanent fashion than IRC.



Thanks again guys!

well I'm bored.

so bored. 

I am so bored, that that almost seems like an occupation 
to be bored. 

Because thinking about how bored I am, takes - at least
for a few seconds - the feeling of boredom away.

But for during all the time where i am not thinking about 
how bored I am, I am terribly terribly bored.

So now to escape my boredom I will simply sleep.

At least I never seem to bored while i am sleeping.

...hrmmm

I wonder: Has anyone ever, while in a dream , felt bored?
I mean imagine you are dreaming of you lying around and 
beeing bored. 

...hrmmm

Oh well...i am too bored now to think about beeing bored.

Good night all. (Try to pay attention whilst dreaming 
and see if you feel bored in your dream at any time.)

...for sure to be continued.

Bored,
