Hey there is 2 demos fropm the other night, on is 5 minutes into the first game oagainst *69 and it continues ALAL the way through all 3 matches, OH if you want to acccelerate how fast you watch a demo , when it is playing just type /timescale <#> ,1= default, the greater the number the faster the demo will play 

the other demo is of the inner scrim we had before the *69 match , both from my POV, enjoy
