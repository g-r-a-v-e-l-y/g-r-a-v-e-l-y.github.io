This difficult, complicated maneuver is made up of me and my 135 ping snatching up a rail and trying to miss as much as possible to throw off the enemy's concentration, making it easier for my <i>awesome</i>($$) Shadow team mates to bludgeon the confused enemy to death. Its a tough job, but someone has to do it. And I am sure that the strategy played a key role in the 13-0 sweep that those <i>bodacious</i>($$) Shadow guys ran.<br><br>I was going to go into detail about my various killer strategies on the next map(ctf2), Joker's favourite map btw(9L:ask for this map as much as possible, they love it).

``xI just got back from a lan party in Akron Ohio, hosted by ss-shaka and attended by some surprisingly good players. In the one on one tourney, I got 8th place out of 20 or so contenders. I was playing very poorly but it was still a nice oportunity for some zero ping action and a chance to hang (and stay with) shadow'mayoke and friends in the Cleveland area. Ultimo beat ss-elwood for the first place prize in a very very tense dm6 match that had us all holding our breath. The free Bawls gave me the shakes but it was a great lan and well organised by shaka. The 7 hour drive one-way made the commute almost as long as the lan itself but it was worth the trouble :)<br><br>I'll update this post when the lan's website comes back online with stats and info.``xjokerbone``xlstave1@home.com``xohio lan party``x979598088,26193,``x``x

``xWell as most of you know by now our match vs 519 was a very enlightening experience. From what i understand, 519 has been practicing very heavily as of late and it surely showed by our match vs them. gg's guys very impressive. So our welcoming into EQL was a tough one. I'm confident though that with a little more practice we will have a better showing in future matches. In other news it seems that we have possibly lost a member, e.brent or e.Vakal as not everyone may know him by one name. This is particularly sad for me as brent and i have a history in q3 together dating back to the days of zyklonB which some of you may know of or may not.

``x    Well some bad news rolled around to us last night. It seems we have been removed from the EQL playoffs. The replacement for us is unknown at this point in time. It seems that Criminal who has been one of the main Admins for EQL has been missing for a couple of days. So someone else was forced to announce it to us. All in all i cant say this was unexpected, could we have realistically competed and won? Probably not. To my understanding though, (correct me if im wrong) but we were a replacement for the now defunct clan 5am. We assumed their points and their standings. Now my question I have is if 5am had not disbanded would they have been removed from the playoffs? If we had assumed "their" record and "their" points, then i honestly dont see what the problem is.<br><br>    Honestly I dont believe we are trying to be whiners about this but the whole thing just seems unfair. So ppl are gonna ask "NoccY what do you propose then?" Well the way i see it we are going after a wildcard spot. The only way I see that is fair to address this is to have a wildcard playoff game. 1 set of 3 games for those that are in contention for the playoffs. That way it makes it even and fair. I dont think the EQL intentionally did this to make people mad but they had to look at it in the fairest way possible. That was to let people into the playoffs that had been in EQL from the beginning. But unfortunately they did not plan on clans disbanding and dropping EQL. So they were forced to make a judgement call. To make it fair though let the teams that are in contention play each other for that spot.

``x This late breaking news is brought to you courtesy of our friends over at the EQL. It seems that once again there has been a rule change that has taken effect. Not like most of us care about EQL anyway now that we got booted from the playoffs, but this latest incident shows the level of incompetence that can be achieved when u try. <br><br> It seems the admins of the EQL have unlocked the roster for clans until April 9th. Oh yea i forgot to mention those rosters were supposed to have been locked since week hmm..... what week OH YEA 7!!!!! This change has been based on the disturbance involving the community with clans disbanding and then there members going to another clan. So to make it "Fair" they will unlock the roster till<br>April 9th and then lock it up again.<br><br> Well some people arent to happy about this. ( Can you believe that?).

Along with 519,stx,cK, and Ichor. Im sure there are alot of upset EQL clans that are upset with this ruling. And with good right to be!!!! I believe it was Wheat who said it best over on CHUS "This is DONKEY SHIT!!!"<br><br> So i leave you all with this once again GG EQL!!!!!! I think im gonna start a tourney that has absolutely NO RULES!! and then make them up as i go along. Sounds like fun to me!!!!<br><br> Head over to our message board a post away. Im interested in hearing what people have to say.<br>``xe.Noccy``x``xIts Heating up Again!!!``x986578922,2558,``x``x
``x  Well guys it seems the Badlands tourney is over (unless they decide to have a playoffs.) Great job to all that played in these matches. We came in at the end of this tourney finishing 3rd. Which in my opinion isnt to shabby. Considering we practiced the maps for about what the first 2-3 weeks of the tourney? Maybe im wrong. Anyway finishing the season with an even W/L record of total games 9-9. Diga took the top spot only losing one game with a 17-1 record, and *69 coming in second. Great Job to those teams, (Man Diga has come along way!!!) =D So where do we go from here? Hell i dont really know, Ive posted some of my thoughts on what we should do in the priv. message board, check it out and give some thoughts. Hey if anyone from tp.net happens to stop by and read this. GIVE A PLAYOFFS PLEASE!!! l8er``xe.Noccy``x``xBadlands Over``x986999782,66445,``x``x
``x  Im gonna go on a rant here about something that is completely q3 and clan unrelated. Today is my payday at work and for some reason or another my check was screwed up. Not only my check but a few others were as well. So i attempted to contact our payroll dept. Well I have come to the conclusion that I am sick and tired of voicemail. GOD i hate fucking voicemail. It is the biggest crock of shit i have ever heard of. Cuz i know damn well that person you are trying to call to get an issue resolved is sitting there right there at there desk eating bugles and playing solitair on there pc. How many times have you tried to reach someone and u get the standard "press 1 for sales,<br>press 2 for service, press 3 if you would like to speak to a customer service associate" so you press 3...... time passes phone ringing. Voice mail picks up "Hi this is blah blah Im sry i am either on the phone or away from my desk if you leave your name, number and a brief message i will get back to you as soon as i can.... BEEEP"<br><br> Now im convinced that people dont check there voicemail or its just a giant joke. Because i left (i kid you not) 15 messages to day for this bitch. NO CALL. There was a period of an hour where i tried to call her every 5 mins. Guess what? she was either "away from here desk or on the PHONE!!!!" Yea right she isnt on the phone, she's sittin there laughin her ass off at me cuz she knows that my check is fux0red and its a giant joke to her cuz her check was fine. Anyway if this type of shit pisses anyone else off let me know. Otherwise i must be off my rocker!!!``xe.Noccy``x``xIrritating things``x987032662,34148,``x``x
``xNoccy was our big main page news updater but he has recently left us and joined team -7, best of lucky Noccy.  Anyway I'll be updating often in his place.  We are currently recruiting to combat the forced inactivity some members are facing.  Anyone who is interested in trying out please come to #energy and contact any member.  In other news I am taking steps to sign us up for OGL and becoming more active on TP.net ladders, as soon as we are finished recruiting and have ourselves in order expect to see alot of us :>.  Much thanks to grant for hooking me up with the news account and tech for admin functions on tp.net.

``xJesus christ we go through members like it's cool. Aga, thrash, and myself are the last remaning "original members" and none of us can be considered completely active. Zero*Effect has taken the reign's as energy leader and has already successfully recruited two others, sport and random, whom I'd like to publicly welcome to internal energy. I had some real fears that it the clan would fold with 0fx the only active member but he's determined not to stick to it and we are all supporting him.``xgrant``xlstave1@umbc.edu``xmembership rotation``x988674740,20401,``x``x
``xI'm one of the newest additions to clan energy, and I'm glad to be here. Some of my background: I have been playing q3 since it was released, never played q1 or q2 much on account of my 66mhz Macintosh performa I had for about 5 years. In 1999, I got a brand new PC amd K7-500, which I just recently upgraded with a k7-850 chip. I used to play tdm off and on, and in 2000 when Ra3 came out, I got hooked and have been playing it like a mad man up to this day. Ra3 is getting kind of shallow, and my clan only plays like once a week in tournies, so I decided I wanted to give TDM a whirl after playing some games with Schwar, (a past member of my ra3 team) the guy from ichorvile. I'm a fast learner, and I love TDM now, so I tried out for energy, and I guess they like me :) My name is Dan, I'm 16 (eeeep!!), I live in Knoxville, TN... I also like horsebackriding, long walks on the beach, and sharing milk shakes to the toon of some 80's classic rock (<-- haha liez) k, that's my post!!! :D``xe.sport``xzeph865@bellsouth.net``xHi all``x988675087,24007,``x``x
