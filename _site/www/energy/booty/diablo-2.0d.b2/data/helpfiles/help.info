	A BIT OF HISTORY

	One day, in the recent past, Dave Ford and and Sean McCullough
founded Diablo Internet Services. At first our goal was web design, cgi's,
and maybe a little bit of that annoying thing called ASP. Eventually, we
found DreamBot v0.0.5, and we started modifying it. This was our version
1.0 devel of diablo. Then as we made more and more modifications, added a
configuration pack, we built v2.0 devel. Eventually, we rewrote the entire
bot. This includes the parser and command sturcture. We now had extra
levels and extra commands. Now, a decent bot was born, and it was ours. We
kept going, into the v4 devel series, and on to 5 devel. This time
however, coexisting with v5 devel, we started v1.0r (release). As we moved
through, we released our updates on SourceForge
(http://www.sourceforge.net), and once again, rewrote diablo. As we neared
v1.4r, we completely rewrote the user levels, adding extra levels,
changeing the flags to numbers, and even more importantly. These help
files coexist with version 1.5r, and will be update periodically. Please
visit http://diablo.sourceforge.net/ for diablo's main site and
http://diablo.sourceforge.net/help/ for updated help files.

	ACCESS LEVELS

	There are 7 technical levels in diablo, one more if you include
absolute 0 access. They are the following..

	Level 1 - Normal Ident
	A Normal ident has no access at the current version above a normal
user except for the fact that a normal ident can have stored hostnames and
weather zip codes.

	Level 2 - Avoice
	Avoice is the level directly above normal. This is allows a user
to set certain options such as a password, identify, and also allows the
user to get voice from the bot.

	Level 3 - Aop
	Aop is the first level which can gain channel ops and change other
channel modes, however, Aop does not include a vast majority of functions
that control the bot.

	Level 4 - Sop
	Sop is the level directly above Aop which allows for general
control over the bot. With sop a user can set Ack levels, ident the bot to
nickserv, force the bot to send a string for raw text to the server and
control channels.

	Level 5 - Admin
	Admin is the level which allows for even more control of the bot,
adding commands such as die, restart, and the ability to add and delete
masks from a users access list.

	Level 6 - Owner
	Owner is the level in which a user can control almost all of the
bot functions, including the ability to manipulate the bots global akick
list.

	Level 7 - Root Admin
	Root Admin is the most powerful level on diablo. Root Admin should
only be given out to the true owner and trustworthy users. With Root
Admin, a user can use eval and debug, lock and unlock commands, and even
more powerful, send commands directly to the bots shell.
