<P>hrmph</P>
<P>dig this shit:</P><p>It's late and I'm linked via a slashdot article on Netscape6's failure in some standards compliance<G>to a zdnet article about IE 6 betas...</p>
<P></P>
<P>surf..</P>
<P>surf..</P>
<P>surf..</P>
<P>hrmm, it says here MS recently released something called "MSN Explorer" as a web browser for newbies (not their term).</P>
<P>surf..</P>
<P>next thing you know, I'm at MS.com downloading the thing.</P>
<P>The install begins and it's all purty and skinned (read: <STRONG>slow!</STRONG> - more on my surprising hatred of skins in a future rant)</P>
<P>...along comes the the typical and obnoxious "information gathering" screens - In my paranoia concerning this gathering of personal information, i carefully entered completely wrong data via the holistic "bang the keys" method. This method has been rather successful in the past and it keeps my mailbox on the spam-free side...er.. spam-lite™</P>
<P>whoa! only, on this one, every field must be filled in.. it even caught me when my zip code didn't match the state i decided to claim residence in... (Alabama) - thanks for catching that Bill.</P>
<P>so, I finally get past the EULA's and sign my life away (ha ha, foiled again, i didn't put in my real phone number or mothers maiden name - you'll never catch me!) and I get this screen:</P><A target="_blank" href="images/MSNFull.gif"><IMG height="450" alt="suck suck suck suck MSN suck suck suck suck Explorer suck suck suck suck MSN suck suck suck suck suck suck Explorer suck suck (yes, this is a chant) suck suck suck MSN suck suck suck suck suck Explorer suck suck suck..." src="images/MSNExplorerss.gif" width="600" border="0"></A>
<P>O * W * N * E * D</P>
<P>In my haste, I lied and said I was born in the year 2000.</P>
<P>Silly me.</P>
<P>MSN Explorer should have been congradulating my 11-month-old computer skills instead of making sure i wasn't hitting up <A href="http://www.ampland.com" target="_blank">porn</A> sites</P>
<P>where did the dog come from you ask?</P>
<P>I have no idea - either MS caught the word "bone" in my nick, or every "Mr." gets the puppy.</P>
<P>But why couldn't I override this parental control?</P>
<P>Because in my ever-elusive data entry compliance, I had banged in a load of bullshit for a hotmail address username and had no idea what it was. I had no idea the browser would be broken without it.</P>
<P>Needless to say, the software was immediately uninstalled...</P>
<P>this rant is subject to elaboration and refinement at a more reasonable hour...</P>
