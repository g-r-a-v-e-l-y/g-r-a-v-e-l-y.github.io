Lemon = my hero !|stereotype||11-06-2000 at 01:33 AM|stereotype|xx|0|127.0.0.1|I just wanted to say a few things.<p>Firstly: That was one of the most indebth and revealing discussions on stratagy that i have come across in a long time.<p>Secondly: For writing up these discussions without having been asked, so detailed and which must have taken ages to write up, you have earned my deepest respect and gratitude. <p>For anyone who has not yet read every single post by Brian, I suggest...no I urge you to not only read it, but also follow every step minutely and critically. Internalize the ideas and be prepared to discuss them in an upcomming clan meeting. (I personally admit though, that I was incapable of finding any flaws - although I do have the one or the other idea to add...will do that tomorrow though :P )<p>This is really great stuff, and I hope that we can all practice that tomorrow at practice (starting @ 9.30-10.00pm central/ 10.30- 11.00 eastern).<p>In conclusion: Brian &gt; God &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; satan &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; school
