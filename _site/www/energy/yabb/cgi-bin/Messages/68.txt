welcome|grant||11-01-2000 at 07:01 AM|grant|xx|0|127.0.0.1|I just pulled an all nighter in html mode .. kept thinking of stuff to add. The problem with doing this for so long is the accumulation of errors - please point out any you see to me by replying to this thread..<p>This should be the last time I ask you guys to change your bookmarks :D but you might not even have to. I've changed http://plan-b.n3.net/ to point here and left http://beta-b.n3.net/ pointing here as well.. for the time being.. It of course isn't "done" but it's got the navigation and content to blow the old shit-site out of the water, so i'm busting this in...<p>I took a little time fleshing out some content in some of the pages but honestly, it'd be great if you guys were to offer up some content ;)<p>NOTA BENA:<p>to get to the private section of this board - eg: to post news on the front page, view this sites weblog, etc.. you need to go to the index.shtml (news) file and click on the b in the top right corner. it only works like thar from the news page and the password has not changed. If you have still not gotten a news posting account, ask and ye shall receive.<p>News Posting: i'd like to have so much news on the site that it's worth checking every day. the whole point of setting up the news posting perl script is so that you guys can add contant, whenever and however you want. That means, if you like the game Rune, because you are amused by big brutes bending over to pick up "viking swords", post a link to the rune hompages on with a brief description.. interesting thread on q3world? post a link.. we win a match? post a news item.. etc.. i think you can see where i'm going here..<p>lets keep the posts shortish - if you require legnth, put it in a seperate file and send it to me.. mark, i'm talking to you directly ;) (check the "news essays" on http://acidsun.n3.net/ )<p>I'm still working on getting a Yabb to replace this crusty UBB.. doesn't want to run under NT.. c'est la vie...<p>files: i'd like to have a t3 so i could just leave an ftp account open for you guys constantly up and have a perl script setup to link the files into our files.html  - it's not likely to happen soon (vlad?) so lets decide on what we'd like here...<p>roster: ignore it's current contents - this is one of the "big things" an outsider bothers to look at when checking us out - it's going to be big-bang-boom-fucking-cool.. i'll start that next :D<p>extras: evan, you drunk bastard &lt;g&gt;<p>misc: i realise that it's not completely uniform as far as formating (center/right alignments) etc.. and for some reason, nate has a supercomputer and browses the web full screen so he claims it "looks funny" not fully centered (all of it)... feel free to fill me in on complaints like that - feedback is excellent &lt;G&gt;<p>history: fun page to work together - acid*sun members will enjoy this one - if there is anything i missed/dont' have, please send it ;)<p><p>wow.. a fucking all nighter. it's 7 am. i have class at 2. <p>grrrr<br>(the sun is up)<p>enjoy!<p><p>Matches: Screenshots/demos of our two official matches + link to teamplay.net homepage was my first thought.. could be much more here (stats.. etc)<p><br>
welcome|grant||11-01-2000 at 07:19 AM|grant|xx|0|127.0.0.1|just checked in netscrape navigator - for those of you forced at gunpoint/ constrained by your OS to use a browser this old and broken, I apologize. The entire site _should_ be cross broswer in ever way except _here_ ;)<p>this "messageboard" page consists of frames and the only possible way to do it is by using frames with absolute sizes, in "pixels"<p>the top fram should be a set number of pixels high before giving way to the other frame. Netscrape cant count pixels becauase it was written three years ago. I'm sorry. you should still be able to browse the rest of the site ok.<p>Grant
welcome|grant||11-02-2000 at 01:43 AM|grant|xx|0|127.0.0.1|Vlad - I'm quickly approaching the mirror point on this site - there are a few more modifications but generally they rely on having a better server - If you are willing to offer the space we can swap out the acid*sun page you are currently hosting and put in the plan:b site.<p>This time, the swap will be much more difficult so I'm looking for cgi scripts that will "do it automatically" but we'll see.. if not, i'll just telnet in like last time.<p>Reply here when a good time to meet about this will be and we'll get cracking ;)<p>Thanks man!<p>Grant
