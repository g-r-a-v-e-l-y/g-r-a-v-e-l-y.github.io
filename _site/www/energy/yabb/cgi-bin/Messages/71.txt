I am putting these on the board so we can all come up with something that works. Agreeing, minor adjustments, no idea or total ripping down and putting up a new strategy is appreciated. Please comment either way.<p>DM 14.<br> On DM14 I suggest putting two players at the RA/RL area, one player at Lower RL/ Rail and the final player at the LG/YA. <p>2 RA/RL Players:<br>Always try and keep one player near the RL. There are two spawn points back there and you don’t want to lose the area because someone snags the RL when you go to RA. Share both items there. Hold the area and don’t chase the enemy to far past hall by rail or hall going to quad area. Also try and control the shotgun when possible.<p>Lower RL/Rail Player:<br>This person should only go to rail to pick it up. The same is for YA and RL. Only go to bottom when you are picking these items up unless you need health or are chasing the enemy. The best place to stay is near health between the stairs connecting rail and YA areas by the hole in floor to bottom. From here you can pick off spawning enemies in hallways by rail and YA area. You can also hear enemies coming below you. When you hear them drop down the stairs and catch them either at YA or RL, don’t give them a path up the stairs by the RL.<p>YA/LG player:<br>Your either going to get your weapon somewhere else and then head here then hope the enemy brings you guns. Once well armed the spawns and lack of weapons in this area make it easy to control. <p>Binds:<br>Help @ RA<br>Area Secure<br>The RA players will hit Help @ RA when they are under multiple attack and it doesn’t look good. The LG/YA and Lower RL/Rail players will come to help out. If the RA players survive and the attack is over the other players will go back to their area. If they have to re-take the area they should hold it until the original RA/RL players return. The bind Area Secure indicates the attack has been stopped and to return to your area. Do watch for the enemy running away from the RA/RL, they might run right into the players that were coming for support.  <p>Battle Suit:<br>One of the RL/Ra players should drop down just seconds before the battle suit spawns. Rocket Jump over void and bounce back up to RA/RL area asap.<br>Quad:<br>The other three player will rush the quad. A time should be set up (10 or 20seconds) to all rush the quad at once. The quad area is small so an early setup doesn’t work that well. The time is needed because the three players will most likely be coming from different directions. Lower RL/Rail player should come up the bounce at quad area. Try and wait out of site until you hear the fight start above you to avoid anyone camping the bounce. LG/YA player will be coming from outside by the LG. The RL/RA player that doesn’t get Battle Suit will come rushing in the long hallway.<p>Recovery:<br>If we all get killed and the enemy has the RA/RL we should try and take lower RL area. Wait for the next quad then take RA/RL area and protect the doors starting with the long hallway from the quad area. The enemy will likely come this way once they get the quad. <p>The Voids:<br>Avoid them, nobody plans to go in the hole but somehow we all fall in sooner or later. Only go to the Battle Suit area to pick up the battle suit. When near the lower RL only go near the void to get the gun or go up the stairs. <p>
