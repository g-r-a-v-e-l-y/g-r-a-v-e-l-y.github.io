URGENT! plan:b irc meeting needed |stereotype|m-roberts4@northwestern.edu|11/14/00 at 12:48:29|stereotype|xx|0|199.174.176.193|We finally have what I would considder a hand full of starters for upcomming matches. That is all good and well, but apart from a no brainer &quot;all four at RA&quot; on dm7, we have absolutely no stratagy on any maps.<br><br>No Brian has gone to a hell of a lot of trouble to make some darn solid suggestions on how to play dm7, dm6 and dm14, and I must admit I have not heard a single comment on his ideas, so as that is all we have (and I think it's A LOT), this is what we will work from.<br><br>What we need to discuss is what exactaley every starter as an individual will do on every map. Before we do that, it is pointless to practice, as we don't really practice anything we couldn't do on our own.<br><br>Just to get some discussion started my suggestion for dm7 would be as following:<br> <br>Until we grow together as a team all four players should be at RA and all 4 players should go early and seal off quad.<br><br>dm6: Monty you should hold RA, time it and share with the team.<br><br>Thrash you should support Monty at RA also, but time RL instead of RA. Also I think you should stay at RA and not at RL, only going to RL a few seconds before RL spawns. Neither you nor Monty should abandon your positions for anything except<br>quad or if you are dangerously low on health and there are enemies attacking (staying alive is ALWAYS more important then holding a position).<br><br>Tanon, I think you should be at YA/plasma. Your job is to pick off spawns and (!) time Rail. You should not camp rail, but only move up to it before it spawns. You of all members should have this bind: &quot;Railgun available&quot;. This bind can be triggered if you are not actually able to get it yourself due to attacking enemies, or i.e. if you are waiting for YA to spawn. This position is difficult to hold, so expect to die a lot :P - non the less it is VERY important to be there.<br><br>Depending on ping, form and practice attendance either Lemon, Grant or myself will be the fourth starter. (If there is any disagreement, please fire away) <br>Now I know that many of you will disagree with me here, but contrary to standart stratagy, I do not believe that in our position we should have our strongest player, but rather our &quot;weakest&quot; player patroling the lower area between the RA jump pad and the stairs to YA. I think, that our greatest priority as an unexperienced team should be holding RA and trying to keep RL away from the enemy (if we play a strong railing team, our success largly depends on how accurate you can time rail tanon ;) ). <br><br>The reason I think it is ABSOLUTELY VITAL that we assign positions, is that as an individual you not only need a goal, but moreover you need to be responsible for something. It is Monty's and Thrashy's job to take care of RA. TOm should furthermore keep an eye out for RL. Tanon's job is to time YA and make sure he gets rail. The fourth player should try as best to his ability to get spawnfrags. If a) he is low on health, he should retreat to wither RA if possible or to YA, where he will find teammates to help him out. This also works the other way around: If RA or tanon at YA is under heavy attack, you must immediatly abandon position to help them. If Monty or Thrash call for help at RA, it is the 4th player, who is to rush to help them - NOT tanon and vice versa. <br><br>dm14: I do not think that against a strong team, we will be able to hold RA/RL with two people. Therefore I would like to suggest the following:<br><br>Monty, Thrash and the 4th player @ RA/RL.<br>Monty: you will time Battle suit to the split second.<br>Thrash: you will time RA<br>4th: will time RL<br><br>tanon will try and disrupt the enemy by infiltrating and contolling lower RL/YA.<br><br>Most important: Time the fucking quad! :)<br>AND: learn the map's geography!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>Quad is not easy to control on this map. However I must admit that I slightly disagree with Lemon in only going late for quad. I do believe that it is possible to successfully shield off quad with 3 people.<br><br>Monty will grab BS, so his absence at quad will make things a bit more difficult, but nowhere near impossible.<br><br>At quad one should be at LG looking over jumppad infront of YA. One should be watching and listening(!) for enemies comming from the entrance way from RL/RA (which if we had the RL/RA area controlled should not be a HUGE threat) and last but not least one should watch the jumppad in the actual quad room (he should be aware that people will tend to wait late to come out of that jump pad - most likely someone will come out once a battle in quad has broken out...always watch that with the back of your eye)<br><br>Questions? Comments? dm12? <br><br>I want everyone to fully internalize their role on each of these 3 maps! In addition EVERYONE on in plan:b should know each and every position on each and every map by heart, as it is more then likely that you will have to jump in for a match occasionally, and of course a) for scrims and b) for intra clan practice.<br><br>I will try and get all starters together and have a meeting among us to discuss and eventually alter some of what you have just read. This was only a suggestion. Not a &quot;dogma&quot;. But we need to start somewhere, and apart from some good attempts at dm7 we have not started anywhere yet.<br><br>We finally have our roster together and it seems that we are slowly comming together as a team, but now is the time to take this a step further.<br><br>With &lt;3 and respect,<br><br>Mark<br><br>

We need work badly on that map as well. &nbsp;Strategy seems difficult on that map, but I would assume that the rl would be the key, seeing as how from there you have direct access to YA and QUAD. Its also fairly easy to defend with the only real entrance being the jumppad.<br>You also have a great view of mega from up top, making it easy to get to as well. &nbsp;Of course aim will probably be the biggest factor on that map. &nbsp;<br><br>Bryan

Watching that kornelia video - she used the home/end/pgup.. that could really work for me :) (no, i won't go to the asdf or whatever.. those keys aren't straight up-and-down so i can't use them)<br><br>As far as map strat goes - it's great to get these big-picture ideas down but i'd also like to work a lot more on the details when we play. <br><br>I of course commit all these errors more than anyone but: <br><br>[quote]- be as aware as possible of your teamates weapons and consider how you might aid them best. The most painfully obvious is that if you are stuck with mg, and your teamate has an RL, &quot;back tha fuck up&quot; should be your first thought. Its much easier to support your teamate with a few mg hits from a distance than it is to confuse his aim up close. duh. <br><br>gauntlet? Run! at worst, you'll die, at best, the idiot on the other team will chase you into a room full of your armored and armed teamates *cough* <br><br>now i'm certainly not claiming that i don't do this, but until it becomes as automatic as owning an ffa, this must be a concious thought for everyone.<br><br>weapons- if a you are about to die, and are running backwards shooting your wad, please shoot your wad with an mg instead of giving the baddie a fully loaded rl. there are cases where you may want to leave a weapon for a teamate when you die (to a quad carrier, etc) but this is another thing that would greatly improve our map control.<br><br>We need to come up with a way to communicate &quot;who gets what&quot; weapons in a map in realtime better - too many times we have chased eachother up to rl in dm7 in a race. this is teamwork at its worst. if you see a teamate camping a weapon when you spawn, you can hit your &quot;need weapon bind&quot;.. if they don't get out of the way to let you wait for it, then beat it. <br>[/quote]<br>There were a few other things i was thinking of but all in all i just want to note that it's great having such a lively and thinking clan again after such a long summer - nice work guys - we are improving. definitely.<br><br><br>
