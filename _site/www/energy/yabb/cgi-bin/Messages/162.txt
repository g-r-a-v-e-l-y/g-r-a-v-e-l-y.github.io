timer cfg. comm bind cfg. etc|jokerbone|lstave1@umbc.edu|03/10/01 at 17:34:13|jokerbone|heart|0|24.23.47.111|Monty and I are going to be working on a new clan-wide cfg for all tdm communications...<br><br>I hate to be an asshole, but once we are done, this cfg will be -MANDATORY- for all users. you don't have it, you don't play for energy that night. (exceptions can be made of course, but cummon. wtf would you want to hold back your team by not commuicating with them)<br><br>We would certainly like some input on what binds you find most helpful and what binds you find least helpful.<br><br>I will say this though: this timer cfg is pretty complicated - we will be running drills in maps so that you can communitcate with it like it was natural as straffe running. Every time you take an ra and don't say when it'll be up next, you are giving ra to the other team. Every time you see an enemy take mega and you dont' say that it'll be up next, you are giving them the next mega too, and since we have to assume that the other team -is- timing these things like a real tdm clan would, every time you don't time anything, the other team just got the next one. and the next one. and the next one. <br><br>We can't count on &quot;being luckily in the right place at the right time&quot; to get powerups in q3tdm when q3tdm is almost entirely centered on who posesses the powerups. <br><br>The same is true for weapon control, map control, etc etc.<br><br>if you make the stupid mistake of not looking at the TO before blindly hitting the bouncepad to ra in dm6 and you get held up by one guys lg while the other two guys are trying to rail you, the least you could do is point out to your teamates taht there are two enemy's in ra room w/ weapons. The existing planb.cfg allows for this level of communication, scripted, easy.<br><br>k. anyway, this turned out to be a rant :) sorry.<br><br>feedback?
