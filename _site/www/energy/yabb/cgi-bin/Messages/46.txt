"news" section of http://plan-b.n3.net/|grant||10-23-2000 at 09:15 PM|grant|xx|0|127.0.0.1|hiya kiddies.<p>I just put a news section on our homepage that is "updatable" by anyone with an account by heading here :  <A HREF="http://24.23.47.111/b/CGI-BIN/newspro.cgi" TARGET=_blank>http://24.23.47.111/b/CGI-BIN/newspro.cgi</A> <p>of course, you need to give me a password that you'll remember and others won't guess to get a posting account. This also (of course) will be moved to the front page of the eventual site, once i get the look nailed down - it's very very very generic right now.<p>also - html tags within news updates are allowed, just _please_ remember to close font tags, if you use any. ;)<p>ty<p>grant
