The mother board on my p3 800 melted and i had to dig up parts to get an old system running. right now i am limited to a voodoo2 vid card and the whole thing is so slow i haven't been doing anything on it all. because of money then ordering parts it will probably be between 1-2 weeks before i get a chance to play again. i just wanted to let you know where i was and believe me, i will be around a lot once i get my shit straight again. &nbsp; &nbsp;cyas in a bit
