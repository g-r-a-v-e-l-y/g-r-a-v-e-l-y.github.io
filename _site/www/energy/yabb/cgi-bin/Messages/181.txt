Phenom` goodbye|Oleg Zhovnir|dkphenom@bellsouth.net|03/24/01 at 22:52:42|DkPhenom|xx|0|216.78.161.103|Alas, another one bites the dust.<br><br>I didn't last long. But the times that I had with you guys were great. I particularly enjoyed playing with eveyrone when i just joined the clan. We seemed to have a purpose, motivation and ENERGY. As times went on things got a little crazy and out of hand. Many were plagued by various problems. I thought I could stick it out and wait until the storm settles, but I couldn't. <br><br>In my opinion, I tried to help in any way I could. I thought I had some good ideas for the clan to try. However, the group of ppl that we have right now is very disorganized and is hard to set straight. Many of you have egos and and not open minded, which prevents you guys to try new things or rather MUCH NEEDED THINGS. I still think that for this clan to survive you need A PERSON WHO TAKES CHARGE. I hope you guys can find that person.<br><br>In conclusion, I wish all of you luck whether it be in a clan or individual gaming profiles. I hope you all succeed in real life too. And no matter what, I will try to remember this clan for all the positive things i got from it - all negativity aside. And remember guys that the name of this clan isn't just a tag - energy is all the clan's characteristics rolled into 1 word. Use that to your advantage!<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><br>Oleg
