Irritating things:|jokerbone|lstave1@umbc.edu|04/12/01 at 09:04:13|jokerbone|exclamation|0|24.23.47.111|Im gonna go on a rant here about something that is completely q3 and clan unrelated. Today is my payday at work and for some reason or another my check was screwed up. Not only my check but a few others were as well. So i attempted to contact our payroll dept. Well I have come to the conclusion that I am sick and tired of voicemail. GOD i hate fucking voicemail. It is the biggest crock of shit i have ever heard of. Cuz i know damn well that person you are trying to call to get an issue resolved is sitting there right there at there desk eating bugles and playing solitair on there pc. How many times have you tried to reach someone and u get the standard &quot;press 1 for sales,<br>press 2 for service, press 3 if you would like to speak to a customer service associate&quot; so you press 3...... time passes phone ringing. Voice mail picks up &quot;Hi this is blah blah Im sry i am either on the phone or away from my desk if you leave your name, number and a brief message i will get back to you as soon as i can.... BEEEP&quot;<br><br>Now im convinced that people dont check there voicemail or its just a giant joke. Because i left (i kid you not) 15 messages to day for this bitch. NO CALL. There was a period of an hour where i tried to call her every 5 mins. Guess what? she was either &quot;away from here desk or on the PHONE!!!!&quot; Yea right she isnt on the phone, she's sittin there laughin her ass off at me cuz she knows that my check is fux0red and its a giant joke to her cuz her check was fine. Anyway if this type of shit pisses anyone else off let me know. Otherwise i must be off my rocker!!!<br> <br>April 11<br> e.Noccy <br> <br>
