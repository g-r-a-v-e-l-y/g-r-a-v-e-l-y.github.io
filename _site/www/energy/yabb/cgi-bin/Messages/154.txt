Re: ideas on strat here:::|flood|supamart@email.com|03/04/01 at 02:24:39|flood|xx|0|64.192.125.205|Alright, i really wanna get some real discussion going...<br><br>And I'll use the general warning:  I don't claim to know everything.. i'm no quake god, but just one of the guys on the team trying to help out by saying my opinion.<br><br>There's basic strat, which everyone probably should automatically agree on...  Control RA, get quads.  But we need to organize ourselves in getting those objectives accomplished.  I'll start with the RA part...<br><br>In controlling the RA, we should have loaded peeps by the RA at all times.  The # of ppl needed varies from map to map.  Like DM7, we should try to keep 3 ppl at RA as much as possible, and for DM6, 1 person at RA and another in an adjacent area (preferably the RL).  Our goal is to keep the enemy from swiping it and run, or even take control of that area.  By grabbing armor, having a weap, and taking off while the rest of the team is still trying to get a hold of guns/armor, that person is leaving the oportunity for the enemy to take control of it.  So we should try to hold it allowing everyone to grab a peice of the pie (that means saving the armor for others -- if you have 100 armor, you save it for others cause one guy with 200 armor is less powerful than 2 guys with 100 armor), then when we have enuf ppl loaded at RA, extras can move out to take control of other areas (like the rail perch on dm6 for example) while keeping close control of RA.  The only reason we should stop controling RA is when trying to get quad imo.      <br><br>So yeah, that's simple, but what do you do when you lose the RA???  This is where we need to be completely organized.  When talking with STX one time, they said that all the mgs should stick together stating that 4 mg guys are better than one guy with a real weapon. (dunno about badlands lower mg damage though)  Roaming mg guys are just sitting ducks.  So everyone should gather on another part of whatever map we play on and load up.  This usually covers one or more YAs  (ah shit, this doesn't werk with dm12, but whatever).  So when we know we've lost the RA, we need to place priority on the YA's and try to load up there, protecting it as if it were the RA till we have enuf loaded peeps to attack RA.  (what i mean by loaded is having weap and armor)  We can always load up with whatever weaps are near by..  Like on DM6, try to get SG/PG/RG/YA and possibly head to LG or RL with backup...   <br><br>Now we have two options here (again this is just my opinion)..  If we find that we have 2-3 loaded peeps, we can attack RA or wait till quad.. there's usually not enuf time to load up so that we can go straight for RA between quads, but i'll talk about that too..  When attacking RA between quads, we should always attack in groups of 2 or more..  I think that we should always try to attack from separate entrances at the same time (or one at a time) or from the same entrance one at a time, waiting for a couple seconds to let the first guy become a distraction.  &lt;Whew I'm writing a lot here!&gt;  If we use organized attacks like this, we should be able to take back the RA a lot more effectively.<br><br>And the other option is to just get quad...  There isn't too much to say about how to get quad since it's kinda arbitrary to the map played on.  If we get quad, I think the quad guy should always go straight to the RA first... if we didn't have control of the RA when leaving for quad, it might be a good idea for the quad guy to stay at the RA through the whole durration of quad, because if the enemy had control of it before, most likely they'll want to head back there with their loaded peeps...  And if we had control before hand, the quad guy can go on a frag fest after a quick visit to RA... that's only IF he sees that we have loaded peeps in the team overlay to keep control of RA.  <br><br>well I think that's it with my great big bag of cents...  oh one more thing! :9  <br><br>And for more advanced strat, we can always designate roamers for certain maps like cpm4 before a match depending on who's good at what..  <br><br>I think I covered everything that I wanted to say.  you guys better read this cause i spent WAY too much time writing this damn thing!  :D <br><br>and reply!  If you don't agree anything with anything that I said (or all of it even), I wanna know why!  I don't give a shit if you completely hate or what, yr oppinion weighs just as much as mine and i want to hear it. <br>   <br><br><br>               <br>
Re: ideas on strat here:::|jokerbone|lstave1@umbc.edu|03/03/01 at 02:24:53|jokerbone|xx|0|24.23.47.111|I agree pretty much w/ what flood is saying - one thing that should be pointed out (and we make this error a -lot-) is precise quad timing. We get the general idea of quad timing but showing up early to quad on a map like cpm4 or dmp6 (or any map besides dm7 for that matter) is suicide. It's hard to hold a room when being attacked from all sides by an organised team, and for some reason, we always attract games with organised teams.. maybe it's just becuase we're in the fucking eql :P<br><br>To play like an eql team we need to -time- items. As silly as it may seem to say it, tdm is about hogging items. all of them. every time they spawn. For the whole twenty minutes. without dying. <br><br>For those of us that got into &quot;serious&quot; q3 in the tourney arena, this is both a &quot;no shit&quot; point, and a surprise. In 1v1, you spawn, you run for the armor (as permitting). if an enemy is near you, you shoot. Always attacking, always knowing &quot;where he is&quot;.<br><br>Guess what.<br><br>Not possible in tdm. <br><br>Phenom pointed out that we often spawn and go straight into mg-kamikaze mode &nbsp;- i've watched almost all of us do it. <br><br>We should be using the resources available to us - specifically, the team overlay. Again, newbie directions, but it's back to the basics time - like monty always says - if it's not relfex, you won't do it when it matters. <br><br>Before you spawn, note what areas of the map your teammate is in, how much health they have, what weapon they have, etc etc. I seem to find myself only -really- doing this on dm6/dm7 but we need to start doing it all the time in every map.<br><br>Ifyou look up at TO on a fresh spawn in dm6 and see one guy w/ 100/100 in ra, one guy at rail, another that just died near ya, don't go to ya. :)<br><br>yadda yadda<br><br>These are all common sense things and they aren't going to help unless you actually practice them...<br><br>Maybe going to a server and running some drills would help? Load up cpm4 and play hide and seek w/ the team overlay as a guide?<br><br>Everyone also has cg_drawtimer 1 set, but very few have / use the script binds to their full potential. need weap / weap avail are fine, but it's no less work to have use the script - If you frag a guy w/ RL in the ssg room of dm7, wouldn't it be more helpfull to say &quot;rl avail&quot; than &quot;weap avail&quot;?<br><br>we also need &quot;quad is dead&quot; and &quot;enemy quad here&quot; binds to be used with more frequency because we are all going to start being more cautious about kamikaze-mg spawns during an enemy quad run. Think about it. quad lasts 30 seconds. q3 forces respawn at what.. 15? if you die in the middle of a quad run then spawn and die again, you are doing almost intentionally killing yourself. <br><br>*sigh*<br><br>I know my points are obvious, if and when they are even correct, but we need to get back to actually playing solid TEAMdm. When i first got into tdm, there was nothing like the feeling of holding a room, or making that rail across the room to back up a buddy..<br><br>I know &quot;listen to grant - he has the most deaths in every game i see him play&quot; I'm working on it. Seriously.<br><br>:)<br><br>But am i wrong?
Re: ideas on strat here:::|Monty|monty_74@yahoo.com|03/03/01 at 15:00:12|Monty|thumbup|0|24.185.233.159|wow nice stuff grant and flood.. I think both of you have the right ideas and strat.. Just need to play more and those will incorperate into our playing style.keep on trying everybody and I will also. Give it all you got in games and try to expand yourself ,it will show. See losing isint bad right now because we are trying out strats and the way we play.. Its better to lose and to try stuff then to try only one thing all the time and not learn anything.. We are getting there!.<br><br><br>
Re: ideas on strat here:::|flood|supamart@email.com|03/03/01 at 17:54:11|flood|xx|0|64.192.125.205|yeah gg grant! &nbsp;The stuff you said is stuff that we can focus on when trying to form good and necessary habits when playing TDM. &nbsp;<br><br>On DM6, I think going on the second level above quad at least 10 seconds b4 it spawns is a good thing. &nbsp;But long as you know EXACTLY when it spawns, you can swipe it from the opponent and not really need to be there b4 hand. &nbsp;If we all did awesome quad timing, well you know....<br><br>I just wish I could get myself to stop spawning when i died during quad... &nbsp;It's so engraved in my head to hit that fire button when i die! &nbsp;<br><br>but if anyone wants to learn to time items better there's a great article here.... &nbsp; http://www.challenge-world.com/gk/articles/<br><br>By practicing with wimpy bots or newbies, you can quickly work yr way up to timing items consistently in a manner of a couple weeks. &nbsp;For you 1v1 guys, you probably time the armor like mad anyways. &nbsp;<br><br>There are a lot of things that we can practice alone to help our overall TDM. &nbsp;Like I used to practice the DM6 jump for like 10 minutes a day or more.. &nbsp;practicing trick jumps has helped give me better control over my movement... <br><br>and for the drills thing.... YES YES!! &nbsp;I thought of an example to practice the team overlay though it might not be a great idea... &nbsp;That's to have 2 guys on separate teams and have a race. &nbsp;One player from each team would start on one side of the map while one player from each team would start on the other side... then both teams would race to meet with their partners first. &nbsp;This would require the use of the TO as both sides would be trying to fire at each other and would want to avoid each other which would force them to move into different rooms of the map. &nbsp;I dunno, it's just an idea i just had.<br><br><br> &nbsp;
