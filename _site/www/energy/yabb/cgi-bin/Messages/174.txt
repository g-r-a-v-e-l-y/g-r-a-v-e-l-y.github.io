Stuff|Monty|monty_74@yahoo.com|03/15/01 at 20:05:04|Monty|exclamation|0|24.185.233.181|I mean no disrespect for the new members. I dont know you guys so I cant say anything about you..<br> &nbsp;I am very upset right now as to what is going on. I don't like the way things are headed. Sure wow we have more people , but more conflicts also. You know I really would have liked to play with jynx and zero effect before recruiting with them.. I mean what is that , just recruit ppl when I'm not comfortable with it ? That just blows me away totally.. I do not respect that decision and im really fustrated with it. I wanna see things change in this clan , and I hope people respond or ill respond in a even angrier fashion. Im not happy right now , what is the point to play ?... Well I personally dont know if things will work out, and I dont want to cause too much trouble to everyone... Just try to respond with thought......<br><br>ps : miss you mark , hope all is going well.

Re: Stuff|Thrash|viper399@aol.com|03/15/01 at 20:10:09|Thrash|xx|0|65.8.97.145|ya, i thought we should've discussed it before. I asked for a vote while waiting to see how things played out before i went to bed. People agreed but i guess it didnt happen that way. :/ I dunno though, I think I'm having fun playing with you and everyone else in the clan. I try to do my best to make everyone happy. I'll continue trying, but I can only do so much by myself.
Re: Stuff|Thrash|viper399@aol.com|03/15/01 at 20:12:58|Thrash|xx|0|65.8.97.145|I only played with zero once, but he has been playing alot with the rest of the clan, but we should've allowed everyone to give there opinion first. I think we were discussing this earlier and realized we should've done that.
