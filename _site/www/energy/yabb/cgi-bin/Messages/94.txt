Plan:b team.cfg comming soon!|stereotype|m-roberts4@northwestern.edu|11/21/00 at 12:16:33|stereotype|xx|0|24.183.120.92|Based on cK's team binds I am currently putting together (or remodeling) a new cfg, that will opticially be unique, and might add some different binds. The only problem I seem to be having, is that I can't get the timer.cfg to work.<br><br>If anyone has been experiencing the same problem or knows a fix please talk to me. Q3 crashes and takes me to the bluish console - with a red max_cvar blinking.<br><br>Non the less, the new team cfg should be downloaded, learnt (not an easy one!!!) and used without exception by every member at everytime.<br>We can always tweak and update the cfg, but we've got to start somewhere, and everyone using his own binds just doesn't seem to click as a team.

The config is a new set of binds, it has nothing to do with forcing you to use certian keys for movement. You _must_ have written that message at 5 am or something. jeezus. <br><br>These binds - which as you uhm.. should understand.. uhm.. are so much more communicative than our old setup that we are pretty much demanding that every member use them, somehow, somewhere. sorry if you have to &quot;move the binds&quot; but that's kind of not unheard of. figure it out. At the very least, bind all of the weapon vstr's to replace your existing weapon binds, then bind all of the variable commands and the &quot;places&quot;.<br><br>it's worth it.<br><br>:)<br><br>goofball.<br>
