Then i saw marks config, and it looked like shite, but here i am with high picmip.  When players blend into the walls and hide in shadows that's when i knew a line had to be drawn, because that just isnt necessary.  Youll get used to it man, I cant go back.  Also, mark pointed this crosshair out to me, since crosshair additions make you unpure.  For a long time, i used the dot with the circle.  I have just switched to an enlarged (cg_crosshairsize) regular dot.  It has helped my rail aim, and made visability much better.  Then there are some people who prefer slimshaft, im not really a big fan of it.  <p>Check it out for yourself- <br>/cg_fov 300<br>/cg_zoomfov 100 or 90 or 110<br>+zoom<p>Its different, that much i know.  I dont plan on switching to it<p><br>
