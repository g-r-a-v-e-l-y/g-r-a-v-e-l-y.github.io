It's been dead for a while now - das blinken lightzen.. the tech support people &quot;checked their system&quot; and have determined that there is an &quot;outtage in our area&quot; - basically regurgitating what i had to call and tell them anyway. It should be up &quot;in three days or less - probably less&quot; because the &quot;technicians&quot; are already aware of it. <br><br>Last time we were told this, we called back three days later to find out that their DHCP server fucked us when it reset and turned our account off and that there was in fact no outage in our area.<br><br>lovely.<br><br>bye.
