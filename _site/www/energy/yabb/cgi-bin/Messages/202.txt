Mergers|NoccY|NoCtuRn4L@hotmail.com|04/19/01 at 20:25:42|NoccY|xx|0|12.26.69.6|Well some know and some dont. So I thought i would post it to get everyones opinion. Last night Flood, Myself, Mud, and 0fx, offered up a proposed merger last night with the clan -7. This was an idea concocted by yours truly. The only reason i suggested this is that lately our recruiting efforts have been for naught. We rarely practice together anymore, and even if we did we couldnt get an inner 4v4. The reason i kind of picked this particular clan is due to the fact that they remind me of the energy of old. You can constantly find -7 playing on most servers, and normally its an inner clan thing. Kind of like what we used to do. But we all agreed that we didnt want to do anything without everyones thoughts, It was just a proposed idea nothing is set in stone, They havent even accepted the offer yet. So please if ANYONE FUCKING READS THIS please comment and give us your ideas!!!!!
