I am putting these on the board so we can all come up with something that works. Agreeing, minor adjustments, no idea or total ripping down and putting up a new strategy is appreciated. Please comment either way. <p>DM 7. There are two main areas. The Red Armor and The Rocket Launcher Room.<br>A lot of teams play where they either control one or the other with RA being the better of the two. I have two ideas that I put out there. The first is a control one or the other, the second tries to control both.<p>IDEA #1<br>Keep all four players at the RA. Guard the incoming hallways and share resources. The team times the mega with all 4 players rushing the quad. While players are at the RA if we manage to kill 2 or more enemies in a small time period then one or two players go to quad and then circle back to RA through the mega room killing any spawning enemies trying to reach the RL room. When we lose RA control everyone tries to fall back to the RL room. There we will stay and try to build up arms and armor until the next quad. <p>IDEA #2<br>One Player is assigned to the RL room and the other 3 the RA. The RL player rushes the room and takes control when the quad is spawning and the room is usually empty. The other 3 players try to take the RA and rush the quad. Those players will time the mega but will not spread out in the event we kill a few at a time. If we lose the RA all 4 players fall back to RL room to share resources and build up for the next quad. If we hold RA and have a camper… err I mean skilled player not moving at the RL then we take away their fall back zone and this leads to big scoring runs. If the RL player loses their area they fall back to the RA until the next quad, don’t force taking the area until then. The real battle isn’t the 4on3 at the RA, but the 4on3 at the QUAD since the RL player doesn’t rush it. To help adjust for this right before the quad the RL player picks up the RL and KNOWS one isn’t spawning soon they should head to the YA. From here they can provide cover for teammates running away from the quad or kill wounded enemy but most importantly they can guard the door coming from RL and stop the enemy quad rush from that direction.<p><br>I like idea #2 better than idea #1. I feel that if two teams played each other with equal skill and each had control of the map for ten minutes that #2 would win because they would produce bigger runs when they had control. #2 also limits the enemy to 2 shotguns and a plasma gun while #1 also gives up the RL. Also, while with FL we played SNB to a 77-75 loss. They had 4 lpbs and FL was 3 lpbs and me pinging 250 on a 56k. My numbers were terrible or we would have beaten them. They had us most of the game but we made a big run in last 5 or 6 minutes to fall short.<p>A few other suggestions about the map:<p>Mega timing.<br>I put in my general tdm post how to time the mega. If we ever lose control of the mega and you fall into the portal basement wait for the mega so our team can start timing it again and lock it back down.<p>Quad.<br>For the first quad grab all the weapons/resources near your spawn point and then head for the quad. After that I think we should all try to get to quad 20 seconds before the quad to set up. If the enemy is set up before us we should go 30 seconds early next time. If we can get set up and in place it is easy to kill enemies rushing quad if they show up one or two at a time. I also stated in my other post how to time the quad to the second. If we decide to do a late rush and quad is known to be on 47 then we should have a set time (10 seconds before or :37) to rush the quad. This will avoid showing up and finding yourself in a 4on1 situation. Personally I like trying to get there early for the first few quads at the start of the game. The only time we should switch to a late timed rush is when it appears the enemy is using one their self and all attacking at the same time.<p>Sound.<br>This goes for all 4 hallways on the map. You can stand next to the wall outside of the hall and hear people running when they are in the hallways. When going through hall between RL room and RA area always walk unless you here fighting on the other side. There is probably someone waiting to shoot before they ever see you, especially if all 4 enemies are in the RL room.<p>Binds for this map only:<br>ENEMY @ PORTAL BASEMENT<br>ENEMY @ SHOTGUN BASEMENT (if we have a player at RL whole game this one is used a lot)<p>
