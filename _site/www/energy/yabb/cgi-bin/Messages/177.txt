e tdm|EvilJello|brian@greenkill.com|03/18/01 at 21:49:17|distortion|thumbdown|0|128.113.151.156|i really don't wanna sound like a know it all, i know i'm not the best player. But i do have tdm experience. &nbsp;and i must emphasize that people need to pick positions and stick to it.... holding the key areas of the level is a must to any tdm match. and with all honesty and respect, when i play tdm with ya guys half the time i feel its chaos. like there is no order. &nbsp;yes the job is kill and get the most frags, however that job in itself is much much easier when you own the level. &nbsp;I am perfectly fine with everyone having their own opinions about how tdm should be played, however we have to find out what works for us. &nbsp;which means scrims. a lot of them. and before each scrim, we point out a goal that we want to accomplish. like holding RA! or getting all the quads! these things are important. and you can debate all you want but practicing something and become a **TEAM** is how to be a successful clan. maybe i'm out of line. i don't know. i just think we need to focus on this a bit more, rather than just trying to win frags without any strat.
