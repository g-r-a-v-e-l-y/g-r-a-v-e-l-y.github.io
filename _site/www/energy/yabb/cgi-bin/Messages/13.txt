He has<br>broken himself so often that he is mended in a hundred places, and<br>doesn't look at all pretty.  Here he comes now, so you can see for<br>yourself."<p>    Indeed, a jolly little clown came walking toward them, and<br>Dorothy could see that in spite of his pretty clothes of red and<br>yellow and green he was completely covered with cracks, running<br>every which way and showing plainly that he had been mended in<br>many places.<p>    The Clown put his hands in his pockets, and after puffing out<br>his cheeks and nodding his head at them saucily, he said:<p><br>                    "My lady fair,<br>                       Why do you stare<br>                         At poor old Mr. Joker?<br>                       You're quite as stiff<br>                         And prim as if<br>                           You'd eaten up a poker!"<p><br>    "Be quiet, sir!" said the Princess.  "Can't you see these are<br>strangers, and should be treated with respect?"<p>    "Well, that's respect, I expect," declared the Clown,<br>and immediately stood upon his head.<p>    "Don't mind Mr. Joker," said the Princess to Dorothy.  "He is<br>considerably cracked in his head, and that makes him foolish."<p>    "Oh, I don't mind him a bit," said Dorothy.  "But you are so<br>beautiful," she continued, "that I am sure I could love you dearly.<br>Won't you let me carry you back to Kansas, and stand you on<br>Aunt Em's mantel?  I could carry you in my basket."<p><br><i>i love literature, don't you?</i>
