ehem!|flood|supamart@email.com|03/27/01 at 23:42:43|flood|xx|0|64.192.125.205|Hey everyone.. &nbsp;I just wanted to give you guys a better idea of what I'm going to do to take on this role as leader of the clan. &nbsp;I feel that as leader, my main job is to solely give direction so that we can try to get better in our teamwerk and strategy. &nbsp;Basically what's most important to me is to try new ideas in strat and see what works best for us. &nbsp;For doing this, I hope we can have scrims or inner-clan games and I will just say basically that we'll try some plan that we'll all try to follow through with it as best as possible. &nbsp;I have one strat in mind that will be as simple as possible to follow and we'll see what happens with that. &nbsp;If that doesn't werk, we'll try something else.... &nbsp;All I want to do is direct ideas that we all have instead of arguing about them. &nbsp;We try it out and see what werks, but that can only be done if you guys listen to me and we werk together as best as possible. &nbsp;I don't want to end up on some server trying to explain something or one of you guys explaining yr ideas, and having the rest of us wonder around goofin off in warmup mode. &nbsp;I've seen that way too many times and all that ends up is with a couple guys understanding and the rest not knowing what to do and we never find out if it's a good plan or not. &nbsp;So basically what I'm saying is that I want to do what's best for the clan and I hope you guys try to do the same. &nbsp;I'm not here for some ego trip loving up the job just so I can boss people around or whatever... personally, I'd rather not have this job, but I know this is for the best if we ever want to become a great clan. &nbsp;I see clans like diga and snb destroy us when I grew up on the same level for a long time and all of a sudden those guys got their act together so that they werked well as a team. &nbsp;It's not like they have a ton better aim than us or anything, it's just that they know how to help each other out and how to werk together better. &nbsp;We can do that if we so choose, but it takes organization in our games and in our inner-werkings of the clan to do that. &nbsp;I hope that I'll be a big help in gettin us farther ahead.<br><br>Btw, I know there are many other things involved in this job, but the most direction I see giving involves mainly in getting our teamwerk/strat together... &nbsp;I'll be sure to keep my eyes on scheduling matches and giving my best guidance in other decisions that are made. &nbsp;<br><br>&lt;3<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
