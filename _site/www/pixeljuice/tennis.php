<b>Analysis:</b>
<p>Talent is high on both sides today; we're going to be witnessing a war of styles.  Contender, Er[i]k Leivo is know to favor his meta political satire, illustrated in a unique interpretation of pop violence.  Enjoying the home court, L. Grant Stavely dances in an enigmatic, "I'm coming right at you", but things seem different, so very very different...  Erk will enjoy the opening serve, giving him the advantage of setting the tone, and he will do so very powerfully.  Grant will have to carefully balance taking over the tone without avoiding it.  The Chinese would label this match up "Rock vs. Water"</p>
<p><b class="tcenter">Erk Serves:</b></p>
<p>
As anticipated, Erk steps onto the court like he owns it.  Everything about his serve feels violent.  He demonstrates his understanding of the mood by his use of passionate colors and imagery, in a backdrop of misery. The emotion of this opening is going to ensure us an exciting match. Though he may be giving grant a perfect rope to pull in order to powerfully counter him, I predict a play on the roses.</p>
