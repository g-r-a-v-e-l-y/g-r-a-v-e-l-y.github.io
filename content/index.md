Hi, I'm gravely. I post about books and music and other media I've enjoyed, new things I've cooked (a lot of pizza, lately), and walks I take in San Francisco, California, where I live.

{aside}
But also [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/_gravely_), [Bookwyrm](https://bookwyrm.social/user/gravely), a few Discords and Slacks (as per), E-mail (guess), [Github](https://github.com/g-r-a-v-e-l-y) (to publish this site), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gravely/) (derogatory), and Signal (ask).
{/aside}

I'm mostly only on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@gravely) lately and kinda not doing social networking anymore otherwise excpet for various private-ish group chats. I'm also on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gravely/) (derogatory), I guess? It's so weird.

I've been using [gimme pizza slow (high quality)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpet67TTVag), inspired by the eponymous edit, wherever I find myself needing a message of the day or banner for a while. Put it in (sic) the pizza.

Give or take quite a lot of unfortunate data loss over the years, I've been dragging some of these posts around for 25 years through WYSIWYG editors, text editors, self-taught (with a lotta help from my friends) PHP, [Movable Type](https://web.archive.org/web/20021127162851/http://jokerbone.com/), [Wordpress](https://web.archive.org/web/20041129200618/http://www.jokerbone.com:80/
), [Textpattern](https://textpattern.com/) (the best of the bunch in my opinion), and [octopress](https://web.archive.org/web/20180322055328/http://archives.grantstavely.com/), which is where I left things when I bailed for Twitter and [Tumblr](https://web.archive.org/web/20180330002228/https://grantstavely.com/), which I've also since deleted, and now, [{{ eleventy.generator }}](https://www.11ty.dev/).

Posts per year since 1999
{/aside}

The oldest posts kind of predate blogging, but I was dating my updates in ways that made sense to import. The next generation of posts were from when my friends and I used my website as a message board, to make plans, or post about parties we'd just been to, which made sense at the time, I guess? Once I moved to blogging engines, the guest posts taper off and it's just my own bad ideas. In almost all cases, I've only ported over my own posts. Once social networks took off, I mistakenly posted on them instead. Oops.

It seems like every migration, I managed to port some posts to the new thing while accidentally leaving others behind. Oh well. For this archive, I've also more intentionally cut out a bunch of stuff, which is for the best.

This website is built using the [{{ eleventy.generator }}](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [Bliss](https://github.com/lwojcik/eleventy-template-bliss), by [Łukasz Wójcik](https://lukaszwojcik.net/), which I clumsily hit with a hammer a few times, and hosted in S3. I'm importing mastodon content using [mastodon-markdown-archive](https://git.garrido.io/gabriel/mastodon-markdown-archive). The typography consists of [ET Book](https://edwardtufte.github.io/et-book/) and [Gill Sans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gill_Sans).
