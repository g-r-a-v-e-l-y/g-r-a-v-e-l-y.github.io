# Hi, I'm gravely (he/him)

<img src="/images/selfie-winter-2024-no-blur.jpeg" alt="Selfie from December 2024 that I took at a kid's birthday party after showing my kid what he looked like in a party hat and then going to take a pic of him and his friends and oops the camera is backwards, might as well take a selfie first." class="myphoto" />

I post about books and music and other media I've enjoyed, new things I've cooked (a lot of pizza, lately), and walks I take in San Francisco, California, where I live.

I'm mostly on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@gravely) lately and kinda not doing social networking anymore otherwise excpet for various private-ish group chats. I'm also on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gravely/), I guess? It's so weird.

This website is built using the [{{ eleventy.generator }}](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [Bliss](https://github.com/lwojcik/eleventy-template-bliss), by [Łukasz Wójcik](https://lukaszwojcik.net/), which I clumsily hit with a hammer a few times, and hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/g-r-a-v-e-l-y/). The typography consists of [ET Book](https://edwardtufte.github.io/et-book/) and [Gill Sans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gill_Sans).

I've been using [gimme pizza slow (high quality)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpet67TTVag), inspired by the eponymous edit, wherever I find myself needing a message of the day or banner for a while. Put it in (sic) the pizza.
