I tend to divest[^1] from a thing when people call for that, and I'm able, so I've probably eradicated almost as much as I've posted out there over the years. Sometimes I regret it but I seem to bias for doing it anyway. Weird right?

This is what's left.

* [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/_gravely_)
* [Bookwyrm](https://bookwyrm.social/user/gravely)
* [Discord](https://discord.com/users/gravely#6679)
* [Github](https://github.com/g-r-a-v-e-l-y)
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gravely/)
* [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@gravely)

Er, not left. Whatever.

[^1]: I deleted my Github some time in the 2010s and only brought it back for this site, so not much to see there. I also deleted my LinkedIn some time in the 2010s and only made a new one for the day job so like, don't feel bad if we used to be connected and aren't?
