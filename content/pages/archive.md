Give or take quite a lot of unfortunate data loss over the years, I've been dragging some of these posts around for 25 years. From typing out html long hand, to pipe delimited files and my own php-cgi, [Movable
Type](https://web.archive.org/web/20021127162851/http://jokerbone.com/), [Wordpress](https://web.archive.org/web/20041129200618/http://www.jokerbone.com:80/
), [Textpattern](https://textpattern.com/) (the best of the bunch in my opinion), and [octopress](https://web.archive.org/web/20180322055328/http://archives.grantstavely.com/), which is where I left things when I bailed for Twitter and [Tumblr](https://web.archive.org/web/20180330002228/https://grantstavely.com/), which I've also since deleted. It seems like every migration, I managed to port some posts to the new thing while leaving others behind. Oh well.
