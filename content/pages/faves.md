I feel like I bring more effort to trying to get into stuff for the first time when I've gotten assurances from someone whose opinions I repsect that it's worth it. "I like this stuff, mabe you will too."

This is the stuff I say that about.

### Artists

* [Paul Rickards](https://shop.paulrickards.com/) - Paul collects and uses vintage pen plotter devices to use with modern computers and code like Python to create new works of art. I've got a bunch of Rickards stuff up at home.
* [Leagh Gardner](https://leahgardner.art/) - Leagh started oil painting in 2020 and by 2021 was a working artist. I've got an original pigeon at home.

### Authors

I have been trying to post what I read to [my BookWyrm](https://bookwyrm.social/user/gravely) for a few years but I'm a completionist and will pre-order when it comes to these authors (why link to Auster, Dick, Le Guin, King, Vonnegut, etc who I also enjoy?) so they get a special link section.

### Apps and services

* [1Password](http://1password.com/) — password manager.
* [AllTrails](https://www.alltrails.com) – I use this a few times a year but pay because I never know when I'll want to get to a trailhead and have a map of it.
* [Amethyst](https://ianyh.com/amethyst/) – Mac tiling window manager. I use full screen and split screeen only.
* [AmpliTube](https://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/amplitube5/) – With headphones, the ultimate practice rig.
* [Anylist](https://www.anylist.com/web) – Our family plans groceries and menus in Anylist. I'm super bummed there's no export as I've got a hundred recipes or so, but it works well so whatever.
* [bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/) – "at the show", "wherever the artists says to buy it", "bandcamp", in that order.
* [bandsintown](https://www.bandsintown.com) – get notified when artists you like are playing in your town. This is what I used to use last.fm for before that got crappy and I deleted it for reasons I forget. It's ok. the mac app is buggy as hell but the service works ok when I remember to keep adding artists to it.
* [CityStrides](https://citystrides.com/) – I'm trying to walk every street in SF so I pay CityStrides to import my Strava, who I also pay but don't list here, to keep track. I would skip the Strava step if I could.

* [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com) - I finally stopped hosting my own mail and switched to fastmail in 2013 and have never looked back.
* [FitBod](https://fitbod.me/) - one hour a day, "bodybuilding" profile, do whatever it says, it's great.
* [Guitar Pro](https://www.guitar-pro.com/) - guitar sheet music and tablature! invest in tools to learn, stop using bad ascii tabs.
