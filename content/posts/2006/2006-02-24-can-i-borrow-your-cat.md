Amanda got an e-mail from the neighbor living below usâ€¦


> This might sound weird, but can I borrow your cat for a few days? I think I heard a rat in here this evening. I haven't had rats since my sister (and her cats moved out). I think if your cat was in here overnight a couple of nights, it would be "goodbye" to Mr. Rat.

Amanda's two cats are rescues, one we are pretty confident is retarded, the other mentally abused - leashed when the owner was home, caged when not.

I have a scar on my hand from holding my kitten near a window when the trash truck drove by the day we moved here, a month and a half old. I don't think he's much of a mouser though, and an Adams Morgan rat could be bigger than he is!
