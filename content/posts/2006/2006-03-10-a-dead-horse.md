DC Council member Barry:

> "There is a sort of an unwritten code in Washington, among the underworld and the hustlers and these other guys, that I am their friend," Barry said at an afternoon news conference in which he described the robbery in detail. "I don't advocate what they do. I advocate conditions to change what they do. I was a little hurt that this betrayal did happen."

Not the freshest quote, but damn if it isn't ballsy. Quoted below is how the average politician would have approached it perhaps?

Senator Geary, _The Godfather: Part II_:


> Uh, Mr. CHAIRMAN -- I would like to verify the witness's statement. For years now a growing number of my constituents have been of Italian decent -- and I have come to know them well. They have honored me with their support and with their friendship. Indeed I can proudly say some of my very best friends are Italian-Americansâ€¦
