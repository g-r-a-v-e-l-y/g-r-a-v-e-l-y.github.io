I use mozilla on win32 at work. Of course any company worth their salt will have an intranet that is IE only. Lo and behold I find [this](http://ietab.mozdev.org/installation.html) extension for mozilla. This will open predefined sites in a mozilla tab and use IE to render them. I love it. Now I can have 8 tabs open instead of 6 tabs and two IE windows.

It was so exciting I had to share. Enjoy.
