[Alabama - If You're Gonna Play in Texas](http://www.coquet-shack.com/country_lyrics_AB/Alabama/If_Youre_Gonna_Play_In_Texas_0362.php)

vs.

[Nirvana - Smells Like Teen Spirit](http://www.lyricsfreak.com/n/nirvana/101055.html)

I know it's only one extra chorus in the Alabama song but it makes me want to drive a pencil into my ear and the other doesn't.
```shell
> grep "fiddle in the band" alabama If you're gonna play in Texas, you gotta have a fiddle in the band If you're gonna play in Texas, you gotta have a fiddle in the band If you're gonna play in Texas, you gotta have a fiddle in the band If you're gonna play in Texas, you gotta have a fiddle in the band If you're gonna play in Texas, you gotta have a fiddle in the band If you're gonna play in Texas, you gotta have a fiddle in the band If you're gonna play in Texas, you gotta have a fiddle in the band If you're gonna play in Texas, you gotta have a fiddle in the band `
```

:suicide:

For Nirvana:

```shell
> grep "With the lights out" spirit With the lights out it’s less dangerous With the lights out it’s less dangerous With the lights out it’s less dangerous `
```

Of course, 'Teen Spirit has 42 Hello's, so uh…

```shell
> grep Hello spirit Hello (x 16) Hello (x 16) Hello (x 16) `
```
