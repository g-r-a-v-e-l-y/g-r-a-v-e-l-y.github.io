[Reeves Gabrels](http://www.jokerbone.com/2005/04/09/reeves-gabrels-effects/) is releasing a new CD as a two-piece w/ drummer Stefan Svensson. They call themselves [Protecto](http://myspace.com/protecto).

> Reeves Gabrels- Normal & Abnormal Guitars, Fretless Bass, Delayloops Stefan "Big Swede" Svensson- Drums, Perc, Samples, Loops, Keys

I'm [pre-ordering it](http://www.bigswedestudios.com/musicstore.htm) of course.

Unrelated to that project, [here is the latest from Reeve's himself](http://reevz.net/forum.php?view=80) on what's happening in his life lately. It is somewhat old news but I'm seeing it for the first time - looks like 2005 was an absolutely shitty year for Reeves - morgellon's, lyme disease and boureliosis, a divorce, car accident, stolen gear, work getting shelved by labels or poorly released, and more.

The samples on their site are pretty ass kicking ([Reevz.net has better sound quality mp3's](http://reevz.net/news.php) - scrolll down) - I am interested to discover what this Stefan Svensson fellow is doing, adding samples and breaks to kit drum recording and rock music. The track "Charango D'Amour" sounds the most normal, if that's what you are looking for.

(Prediction: myspace.com will get it's own TLD and they will replace the social security system identification system. Internet, rite guys?)
