I was the only groomsman in Ben's wedding on Saturday, making me the Best Man. He is off in Africa climbing both peaks of [Mount Kilamanjaro](http://orangecow.org/pythonet/sketches/killiman.htm) for his honeymoon.

His Kilimanjaro team:

Before he left he threw up a few pics that guests have sent him.

[Aaron](http://www.outerbody.com/) performed the ceremony. The wedding was super cool and everything went smoothly. Thanks to everyone that helped!
