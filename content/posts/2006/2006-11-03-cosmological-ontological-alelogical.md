That last one sounds a bit too much like illogical to me.

[Beer is proof](http://beerisproof.org/) that God [exists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existance_of_God#Epistemology). Not just some higher power that loves you but the wishy-washy christian new testament post-modern interpretation God.

The author also has thoughts on [Stephen King](http://beerisproof.org/bats_stephenking_andhappyendings/bats_stephenking_andhappyendings.html) and other secular things. He's a normal dude my age.

Hail Eris, I say.
