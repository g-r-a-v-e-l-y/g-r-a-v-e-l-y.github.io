I had great fun following [this process](http://spiralbound.net/2005/05/10/how-to-copy-a-solaris-boot-drive-to-a-disk-with-a-different-partition-layout/) today. I made it to the last bit, but after rebooting the system wants to mount / as a read-only file system, freaks out about not being able to create /tmp, execute cron jobs and do a handful of other really important things and then presents a login prompt.

I'll update this post with what fixes it when I get that far.
