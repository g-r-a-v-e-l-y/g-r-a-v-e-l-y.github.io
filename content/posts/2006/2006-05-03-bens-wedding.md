I landed the roll of best-man in [Ben's](http://www.electricfork.com) wedding. This means I'm obligated to wish them well in a speech which I get to give to the family and friends gathered before me after the ceremony at some point.

I've managed to get Ben to give me the first running so that I don't have to follow anyone that gives a better speech than I have prepared, although he may not have the authority to delegate such a position.

I've googled a bit and listened to these things at weddings. Most that I can find seem pretty silly I think. They retell how the couple met, how I come into the picture, how beautiful Ben's mom is (and how great both families are), how I look forward to being at their 50th anniversary and how I hope for them to have children that live into old-age, as the greeks used to say.

I'm not a very funny person.

I am also not a very good orator.

I will crib speech ideas in this post and comments. Oh God help me.
