I read [this essay on dead trees](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312862075/sr=8-9/qid=1152569624/ref=pd_bbs_9/104-6400619-4200746?ie=UTF8) this weekend while waiting in the alley for prospective buyers to walk through the condo I'm renting.

[The Lessons of Lucasfilm's Habitat](http://www.fudco.com/chip/lessons.html) discusses the creation and evolution of what has evolved into games like Everquest and World of Warcraft. Neat stuff.
