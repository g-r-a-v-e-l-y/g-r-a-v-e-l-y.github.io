[Double parking on Sunday mornings by church goers](http://www.dcist.com/archives/2006/06/30/taskforce_consi_1.php) is making a stink in DC. I don't really follow why this is debatable at all.

If my first through third attempts to move my car / have people blocking me in towed were resisted by Police, vigilante justice would very quickly follow.

I don't live in an area with a Sunday Morning parking problem though, I live in Adams Morgan. The church crowd should park in Adams Morgan Sunday morning - we have a garage and a few pay lots that are mostly empty by 4am or so. Have your churches set up busses back and forth!

People that come downtown forgetting that there are actual residents in those buildings in between your MD or VA county line and the city attraction they are here to see: You suck.
