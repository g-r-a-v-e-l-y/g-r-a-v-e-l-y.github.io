	[Negatron](http://www.mp3.com/tracks/4925547/dl_streams.html) == [Jack Burton](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090728/)

My mind is blown. Seriously blown.

[Negatron](http://www.mp3.com/tracks/4925547/dl_streams.html)

Yeah, that Jack Burton.

You know what Jack Burton always says?

I think this is the only movie I've seen near the number of times I've seen Empire Strikes Back.

AWWW COME ON!!!
