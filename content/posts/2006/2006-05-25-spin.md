[Spin](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0765309386/qid=1148556750/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/102-1813850-3130541?v=glance&n=507846), by Robert Charles Wilson.

I burned through it in four days and found it highly entertaining; a great break from the non-fiction / technical books that are piling up half-read under the coffee table (home brewing, security theory, theism, human-computer interaction, type design, singularity theory, etcâ€¦). I had hoped Spin would last through my two day camping trip this weekend - now I need to make another visit to the book store. After rushing through the [New Vinge](http://www.jokerbone.com/2006/02/25/vinge-rainbows-end/) and forcing myself to finish the much lauded [Ian Banks space opera, Consider Phlebas](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1857231384/102-1813850-3130541?v=glance&n=283155), I'm back in the novel reading saddle this month.
