A client is delivering preloaded video ipods to a few thousand folks as a marketing campaign. I had nothing to do with getting them pre-loaded, when asked I suggested they go straight to apple, which they did.

I'm guessing they have a pretty accurate count of just how many boxes there are that make up this wall behind my desk. The wall comes up to my chin and spans the width of the office. Each box is about two and a half feet deep - 7 video ipods in each.

**update**: There are 1,250 of them.
