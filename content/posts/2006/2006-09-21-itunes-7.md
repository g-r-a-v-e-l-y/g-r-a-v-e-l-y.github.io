iTunes 7 looks nice but behaves very poorly. Any time I play a song from my NAS where about 4/5 of my music is stored would grind it to a halt. Any other attempt to access the NAS while this is happening is extremely slow, if the finder manages to not crash. This is all over 802.11g which iTunes 6 handled with no problem. I tried letting it sit all day to 'catch up' for the past week hoping that it'd work gapless playback through the ~65BG of music I have; no luck.

I have removed all plugins, I have disabled anything in the preferences that might cause it. I think it's gapless playback and a half baked, rushed to market app that only exists to keep everyone's eyes on Apple as Microsoft announces Zune.

[This step by step guide](http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=643213&tstart=0) worked for me to revert to iTunes 6.
