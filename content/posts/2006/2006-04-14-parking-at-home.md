Ah, [the irony](http://www.jokerbone.com/2006/03/12/no-parking/).

The alley that my parking spot is on, off Kalorama between Champlain and Ontario, is getting re-surfaced. I knew about the construction further up the alley for the previous week but assumed that the part where my spot was would not need the work. I went out Wednesday morning to find a dump truck just barely not blocking me, but definitely blocking in the 8 spots next to me. Behind the dump truck was a back-hoe digging up the tarmac. I snuck out and have had to park on the street the past two nights. Tonight (Friday night) I am thinking I'll just not go home.

I should have known - the alley across Kalorama was redone completely prior to starting on ours by the same folks. I have a nice driveway to look forward to.
