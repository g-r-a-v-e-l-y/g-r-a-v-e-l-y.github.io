Our friend Beth is now a Peace Corps volunteer in [Togo, Africa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Togo). She gave us a list of things she can't get locally which Amanda sent out earlier this week. The package had to go in a padded envelope and be under 16oz to prevent it from being too interesting to postal workers more likely to pilfer and steal than deliver the message.

Envelope contents:

  * Seasoning mixes
  * Taco mix
  * Vasoline
  * Listerine Breath-Strips
