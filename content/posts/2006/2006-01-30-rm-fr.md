	<p>In a <a href="http://www.jokerbone.com/2005/10/04/kill-9-lecture-ii/">continuing reference series of unix newbie tricks</a>, apparently some of the oldest tricks in the book still work&#8230;</p>

	<p><span class="imred">Ethan</span> and <span class="imblue">Sasha</span> are technicians under me at work. I&#8217;m fixing it at no charge to the client later this week. I was in a sales meeting during this exchange. </p>

	<p><span class="imred">Ethan</span>: how do i check the amount of free space on a hard drive in unix<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: um<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: shit<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: come on<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: I should know this<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: you call yourself a h@x0r?<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: no, I am just trying to remember how to<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: df<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: at a command prompt<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: hahaha<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: ok<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: so how do i free up space<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: what&#8217;s the spacemonger equivalent in unix<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: oh wait<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: unix doesn&#8217;t have useful utilities like that<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: cd /<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: rm -rf /*<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: no, do not do that<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: why<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: trust me<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: don&#8217;t do that :P<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: well what if i started<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: and control C&#8217;d it<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: then you will be re-installing unix on that machine<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: ?<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: that will do a recursive delete of everything on that machine<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: dude<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: i&#8217;ll kill you<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: I told you not to<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: 7 seconds later<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: you are too fast on the draw<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: tell me you did not do that<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: oh man<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: sad times<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: wtf<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: i did it for about 1 second<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: we can only hope<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: what machine?<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: roflmao<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: this is insane<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: ?<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: well i can&#8217;t log back into it<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: a clients production spam filter server<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: how do i make it so that email starts going to their exchange server<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: um<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: since this box is pwned<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: it had run out of space<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: 40 blocks free<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: 100% used<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: log into their router and change port 25<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: and clear out /var<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: /var is where mail and temp files are kept<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: i can&#8217;t log into the spam assassin box anymore<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: :banghead:<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: tihs is why unix is bad<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: the box will probably have to be rebuilt unless Grant can fix it<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: non gui is bad<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: yes<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: yes<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: and asking me advanced *nix questions is bad<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: waiting 7 seconds after telling me to do the unix equivalent of format c: before telling me not to is bad<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: I&#8217;m sorry I was typing slow<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: (but if you know how to log into a unix box and know how to do an &#8220;ls&#8221;  then you should realize that was a bad idea )<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: ls is the only command i know<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: well, ls<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: uptime<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: shutdown<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: cd<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: now you know 2 more<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: df<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: and man<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: and rm (remove)<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: i love how it doesn&#8217;t prompt you at all<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: that&#8217;s where the -rf come in<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: you were logged in as root?<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: that&#8217;s the only way to do anything on there<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: what&#8217;s the rf for<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: recursive and  -f: Attempt to remove the files without prompting for confirmation, regardless of the file&#8217;s permissions.  If the file does not exist, do not display a diagnostic message or modify the exit status to reflect an error.  The -f option overrides any previous -i options.<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: bastard<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: I&#8217;ll kill you<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: please tell me you are joking<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: joking about what<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: the killing<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: no<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: or that i did that command<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: that you ran that command<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: oh it ran alright<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: for 1/2 a second<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: apparently that was enough<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: it can probably be fixed<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: though if it was out of space, might be a good idea to rebuild anyway<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: it may have just had a bunch of log files or somethign</p>

	<p><span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: get in touch with Grant yet?<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: no<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: sent him a text message<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: ok, cool<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: remember: rm -rf /*  is bad, mkay?  it does <span class="caps">NOT</span> &#8220;Read Mail -Really Fast&#8221;<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: hahahahahaha<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: he got quite a laugh out of that</p>

	<p><span class="imred">Ethan</span>: never assume I know anything about unix/linux<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: lol, so you&#8217;re talking to Grant?  <br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: i just did<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: he thought it was funny<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: and never assume I know what I&#8217;m talking about unix/linux<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: :)<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: well hey we fixed their original issue<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: of not being able to get email<br />
<span class="imred">Ethan</span>: and we freed up drive space too as you pointed out</p>
