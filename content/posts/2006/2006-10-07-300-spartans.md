A movie is being made telling the story of the [the Battle of Thermopylae](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_Spartans).

[Go watch a trailer](http://www.apple.com/trailers/wb/300/hd/).

Amazing.

The Nine Inch Nails trailer music is a nice touch.

I'd love to see a [Rome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome_\(TV_series\)) style series (which is excellent, do watch) documenting all of Greco-Persian wars, excluding the Trojan of course. I want to see Xerxes whip a river with a chain.

Hubris! :cop:
