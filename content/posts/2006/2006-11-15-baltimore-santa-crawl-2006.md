This year has some tipping point potential to turn into total mob anarchy.

I hope that doesn't happen - those of us that [have been](http://www.jokerbone.com/2004/11/18/santa-04/) a [few times](http://www.jokerbone.com/2005/12/13/santacrawl-2005/) (this will be my fourth crawl) need to keep the spirit of the crawl!

As mentioned in my notes of '04, Ropewalk Tavern has terrible security and Santa's tend to drink free from the back bar. Last year it turned into Santa's taking bottles of liquor too and police were called - no good.
