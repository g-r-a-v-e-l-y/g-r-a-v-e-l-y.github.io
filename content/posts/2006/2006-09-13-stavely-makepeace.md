I am just curious enough to hear what this 70's brittish glam-rock band sounds like that has my last name in the band name (found by testing [live.com](http://www.live.com/) searching for myself without quotes) that it was worth buying it used w/ amazon one-click.

I can only find [this blurb](http://www.cherryred.co.uk/rpm/artists/stavelymakepiece.htm) from the label re-releaseing them and don't know if I should expect Bowie, early Floyd, Captain Beefheart, or utter shit.

I also can't find any mention of why they have Stavely (or Makepeace) in the band name.
