**MY FAVORITE SONG**: Updated to [Dig a Pony](http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/DATABASES/AWP/dap.html). ![](/images/emot-bach.gif)

> Lennon: "it's just words, put together for a song" in other words, stop trying to find meaning from nonsense. If it's good to listen to, listen to it, don't analyze it.

Andâ€¦

> Lennon (1970): "I just make it up as I go along" Lennon (1980): "(Another) piece of garbage."

(Used to be [You Never Give Me Your Money](http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/DATABASES/AWP/yngmym.html)).
