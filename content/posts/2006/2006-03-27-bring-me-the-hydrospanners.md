The Millennium Falcon 1 [went off course at about T+40 seconds and took a turn in the wrong direction, crash landing in the Pacific Ocean.

Sponsored by one of the now wealthy founders of [PayPal](http://www.paypal.com/), the Falcon 1 design is the first commercial payload-to-orbit system and hoped to undercut NASA costs by 66%.

MJR recently posted [an mp3 of a talk he gave on computer engineering and how it can be compared to NASA's (and specifically Richard P. Feyneman's) studying space ship engineering](http://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/audio/ranum-forum-2006.mp3) which sheds light on the engineering difficulties these folks are trying to overcome.

Pre-launch chatter:
