All the fun of college (courses) without all the homework!

I always enjoyed my latin class in college, I never did very well on tests. I am interested in history, but not flashcards. I am in the car for a few hours a day.

The Solution: Non-fictional audio lectures.

I'm midway through [the High Middle Ages](http://www.teach12.com/ttc/assets/coursedescriptions/869.asp?id=869&d=High+Middle+Ages&pc=History%20-%20Ancient%20and%20Medieval). Last year I was really digging [Classical Mythology](http://www.teach12.com/ttc/assets/coursedescriptions/243.asp?id=243&d=Classical+Mythology&pc=Search).

At $35 for 24 half hour lectures, it is just over a dollar a lecture for an mp3 download. I find that I repeat-listen to them more than I do the same with some music.
