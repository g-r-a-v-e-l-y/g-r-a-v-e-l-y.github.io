Challenge Club's CD, _A Briefe Description of the Notorious Life of Challenge Club Together With Their Ignominious Death_, [made the city paper](http://www.citypaper.com/music/recordreview.asp?id=9821). The reviewer wasted the first paragraph knocking common groups that people hate on like a high school sophomore - gotta love art critics - then moved to describe the subject at hand. Given that a debut CD out for this long is almost 100% promotional and not a cash cow, I think they should Creative Commons it on their website so that I could provide a few links here to tracks. Alasâ€¦

**UPDATE**: Challenge Club is using cdbaby.com to [distribute their cd](http://cdbaby.com/cd/challengeclub), I picked up one for $8 before they sold out, it seems. Cdbaby will take your e-mail address and e-mail you when they get more in stock. Be sure to check out the half-track, low-bitrate, very poorly tagged mp3 samples of the cd - I much prefer the last four songs to the first four but I am of course biased having lived with one of the guitar players and shared a room with the bass players for over two years in college.

**UPDATE 2**: Got my cd today :dance:
