If you should get the craving, this turned out really tasty.

I was breaking recipes / this is not exact, just what I did, should I try again having forgotten:


### Ingredients

* 1 pound fresh okra, 1/4" slices
* 2 white onions, diced
* 3 cloves garlic, pressed
* 3 stalks celery, 1/4" cuts, with leaves
* 1 can, diced tomatoes
* 2 chicken breasts, diced
* 1 polish keilbasa (substitute w/ andoule) cut bite-sized
* 3 quarts chicken broth
* Peanut oil
* Dash of white pepper
* Dash of Old Bay
* 2 tablespoons flour

1. Set the chicken broth to simmer in a large stew pot. Cut the celery and toss it in. Open the can of diced tomatoes (I used tomatoes with jalapeño) and toss it in. Cut the okra and simmer it until soft in peanut oil. Toss the oka in, replace with the diced onions and pressed garlic, add more oil, simmer until brown.
2. While this is simmering, use another pan to start cooking the sliced sausage.
3. With a fourth pan, begin the roux with 2 table spoons flour and 2 table spoons oil. Put the roux on medium high heat and stir briskly. Continue to stir briskly until the roux is the color of peanut butter - do not allow the roux to burn! If your roux burns, start over.
4. Toss the finished sausage in the pot and replace with the chicken breasts. Add white pepper and old bay to the chicken breasts while they are cooking.
5. Stir your roux. Sautee your onions. Stir your gumbo.
6. Repeat.
7. The roux should be done soon, pour it in the gumbo. Follow it with the onions, garlic and chicken.
8. Simmer the gumbo for about an hour, serve over rice.


I was impressed for my first from-scratch gumbo. Next time I make it, I will be sure to use red and green peppers, as well as something with more kick like slices of jalapeño or habañero.
