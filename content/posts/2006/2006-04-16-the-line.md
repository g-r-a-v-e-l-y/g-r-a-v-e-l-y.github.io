Setting: Underground skate party. A kegger two blocks from the convention center downtown. A live punk band, skaters taking turns in a bowl, skateboard art on display, skate video's projected onto the wall outside, ~100 people present. I'm drinking a beer w/ Chambra, craning my head to look through a wire mesh into the bowl as skaters drop in for more vert than I've ever skated.

A Random drunk approaches.

"DUDE THAT'S FUCKING AWESOME!!"

**hits fists**

I had no idea wtf.

"What's awesome?"

"I TRIED TO GET MY KID TO DO THAT! I JUST SHAVED MY HEAD!" **removes hat** "BUT I TRIED TO GET MY KID TO DO WHAT YOU DID!"

"Did what?"

"THE LINE IN YOUR HEAD MAN! THAT'S FUCKING AWESOME" **high-five w/ fists again**

I decided at that point not to tell him it was a surgical scar but before I could ask him what it meant to him, he was gone.

Guesses?

**Update**:

I got this shot on the very first try with my cameraphone. I tried a few more and none even hint at it as well.

It's just hard to see the whole thing from one angle.

So I photoshopped a little. Levels and hue contrast can't bring out what's not there, so I embellished.

I couldn't resist.

OK this angle actually shows it as he probably saw it:

I don't know why my ears are on fire, someone must be talking about me right?
