Well, Parkville, I guess.

Amanda and I will _save_ more in monthly rent by getting out of DC than Ben and I paid per month for [our last apartment together in Maryland](http://www.jokerbone.com/photos/v/movingtoDC/DSC02783.jpg.html).

That is a show.

I move in about two weeks. I will miss the Nova + beltway Maryland density of decent Pho and Thai places. :(
