I just ordered what will be my first non-hand-me-down television to go with the xbox 360 I picked up a few weeks ago.

It's a 42" Plasma HDTV. :monocle:

I picked the industrial model - it's pretty bland looking, doesn't have speakers or a tuner, or any of the stupid tricks that the version you'll see in Best Buy or Circuit City has. It has hookups for my 360 (assuming I use an rca->bnc component cable which I've also ordered) and Tivo.

Sooooo, A Zenith 32" CRT TV is now for sale, and I'm selling my fancy Sony DVD player as I never use the SACD features it has and the 360 will handle all of my DVD needs. Anyone know anyone that might be interested?
