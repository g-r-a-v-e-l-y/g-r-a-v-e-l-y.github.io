<blockquote><span class="imred">Aziz:</span> we might actually start having a democracy
<span class="imred">Aziz</span>: :)
<span class="imred">Aziz</span>: read away
<span class="imred">Aziz</span>: <a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/node/433">http://ideas.4brad.com/node/433</a>
<span class="imblue">Grant</span>: Â¡viva la republic!
<span class="imred">Aziz</span>: si senior
<span class="imred">Aziz</span>: have you heard about that
<span class="imblue">Grant</span>: ![](/images/emot-rolleyes.gif)
<span class="imred">Aziz</span>: well, getting an interesting conversation with you this morning is like pulling teeth. do i need to come out there and open a can of Moroccan whoop ass on you?
<span class="imblue">Grant</span>: lol
<span class="imred">Aziz</span>: <span class="caps">BTW</span>, here is a good subject to start on your blog
<span class="imblue">Grant:</span> I know almost nothing about the electoral college other than absolute basics
<span class="imblue">Grant</span>: I&#8217;m not bothered that a popular winner could lose in the electoral college, convince me that that is a problem and I&#8217;ll worry about tricks to get out from under it
<span class="imred">Aziz</span>: oh, its how democracy gets put down and basically by paying off 2 reps of each state you can swing the vote
<span class="imred">Aziz</span>: that was funny
<span class="imblue">Grant</span>: it&#8217;s whack-a-mole
<span class="imblue">Grant</span>: i don&#8217;t see that corruption any easier stopped than general corruption of the populace &#8211; all you are doing is taking the number of people to keep an eye on for corruption from a few hundred to a few hundred thousand
<span class="imblue">Grant</span>: to play devil&#8217;s advocate
<span class="imred">Aziz</span>: indeed but its harder to pay a few hundred of thousands so there is a chance of a qualified win :). also note that i guess its just my opinion that if Wyoming throws a vote with hundred thousand people in the entire state how is that fair to CA, NY, IL&#8230;.. which are the states that run the economy
<span class="imred">Aziz</span>: come you fuckin liberal, lets open the discussion on the blog and see what kind of bites we get
<span class="imred">Aziz</span>: :)
<span class="imblue">Grant</span>: lol it&#8217;ll be my assclown friends that dont&#8217; know anything siding with you
<span class="imblue">Grant</span>: but sure I&#8217;ll post it
<span class="imred">Aziz</span>: hey, i don&#8217;t mind if they are siding with me</blockquote>

Amanda asked me what this was all about. Aziz likes to argue that the electoral college system should be replaced with a direct popular vote. Thoughts? Btw, I didn't really call all of you assclowns, I was mis-quoted. I swear.
