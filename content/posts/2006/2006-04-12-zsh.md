I've gone from [fish](http://roo.no-ip.org/fish/) back to [bash](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) and now to [zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/FAQ/zshfaq01.html#l4). Exciting times.


As [Ben](http://www.electricfork.com/) reminds me every time I bitch and moan when someone puts me in front of a shell that isn't my own, I'm retarded and ought to use /bin/sh and be happy. Fuck that.
