Sasha and I lacked the foresight to have enough clean and ready bottles prepped for our last batch - my double IPA and his Hefeweizen.

I cleaned about 80 bottles at once - some from my trash bin, some from a case Sasha had under his stairs for some unknown length of time. Sasha's case, I found, had managed to trap a family of crickets, many dead in the bottles.

I lack a bottle brush.

See where this is going?

I've been drinking the double IPA's this week and hold each up to a can halogen in our kitchen, spinning the bottle to examine the bottom. So far, I've seen one full cricket leg, and a few bits that were questionable enough that I put the bottles unopened in the trash.

This is especially fun when having a beer with dinner and something gets stuck in my teeth.

I've planned better for our next batch and have two and a half cases ready and de-labled.
