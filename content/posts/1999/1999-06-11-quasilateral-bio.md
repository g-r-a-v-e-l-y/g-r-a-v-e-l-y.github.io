Over the course of the past few years, I have created some artwork related to the band that I am in, Curious Yellow. We got our name not from the classic film, but from Jeff Noon's novel, _Vurt_. The graphics on this demo tape are adapted from the book cover of the story. Hence, this is not a distribution cover, it is something I made as a quick j-card for my personal copy.

This is a pattern that I have created in Photoshop and find visually stimulating. Here, the artwork is in more of an albumn cover format, named, again taking from _Vurt_ "Dreamsnakes". I enjoy creating things that give the illusion of depth without utilizing standard perspective, instead relying on layering and atmospheric type perspective.
