Yesterday was portfolio review day for my  admission to the Imaging and Digital Arts major at UMBC. I updated (read foobarred)  this page by accidentally saving over it, downloading  it from webjump and uploading the new version without  removing the banner frame at the top. This caused the  page to not load so UMBC got nothing. zip. nada. 404error. I'll never forget  the moment when a friend called and said "Hey  man, what's up with your site? It's not working or  something."
