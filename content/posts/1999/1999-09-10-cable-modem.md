After a complete lack of anything usefull to add recently, I find myself reopening these files to mention the recent addition of a cable modem to my apartment.  This means a permanent IP and possibly (if I feel the need) a personal url.  Known bugs in this page include: too much text, not enough content, no 'come-back' potential, and the occasional utter lack of compelling design.  Compensation is on the way!
