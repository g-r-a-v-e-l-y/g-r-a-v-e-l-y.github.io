I have recently installed BeOS on my computer and I am experimenting with the powerful graphics OS. Unfortunately, it does not yet support the network interface with which I share a cable modem soâ€¦. Windows wise, I have replaced the entire shell with a program called LiteStep, making [my computer's GUI](/www/beginnings/desktop.jpg) very, very customizable. The rest of my time at my computer is spent playing Quake 3 Arena. I am also back to using ICQ regularly - check me @ 5489690.
