Server  problems allowing me to  only update existing files and not allowing me to  create new ones has mysteriously  gone away. The new  artwork is now online and I am back to working on the content. A new favs page is in the  works with images and sound. I am also planning to  digitizing the demo tape of my band  Curious Yellow and  creating a page for it. Keep comin' back!
