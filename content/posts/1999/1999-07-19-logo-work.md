 I have  been reading all the literature I can get my hands on  concerning cascading style sheets and graphic web design to speed up page  loading. The style sheet ref page has been revamped and a new logo is in the works which can  be seen on the bottom of all the pages now. I am  still in the process of tweaking it both  compositionally and lowering download time. Stay  tuned!
