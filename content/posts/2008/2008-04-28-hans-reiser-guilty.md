The [Wired article](http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/04/reiser-guilty-o.html) concludes...


> From his seat at the defense table, Reiser seemed to offer supporting evidence for that so-called "geek defense" in the form of his own actions, frequently quarreling with his attorney, and interrupting DuBois' cross-examination. In January, Judge Goodman threatened to bar Reiser from his own trial. "I'm not sure whether you're doing this on purpose to screw up the process or it's just part of your nature," the judge said outside the presence of the jury. "I'm tired of you disrupting the courtroom."
>
> DuBois made little effort to hide his frustration with his client. The biggest bone of contention was Reiser's insistence on taking the stand himself — a move that may have been Reiser's undoing.
>
> On many of Reiser's 11 days on the stand, jurors were seen shaking their heads in disbelief, laughing to themselves and wearing skeptical looks.
