The SMTP RFC’s have been replaced! A few things from the list caught my eye:

*   No spaces are permitted after or before the ‘mail from:’ colon.
*   587/submission is back in play and recommended
*   Lots of striked-out garbage
*   Post DATA 550’s!

The previous RFC on all but the ‘mail from:’ items have been ignored by most sysadmins for security reasons.
