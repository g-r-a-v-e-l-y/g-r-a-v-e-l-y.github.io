[Pizza Paradiso](http://eatyourpizza.com/) is my all time favorite neapolitan pizza, [beer bar](http://eatyourpizza.com/about_birreria_paradiso.php), and restaurant. If ever find yourself in Washington DC, make a point of stopping in.

The owner and chef RuthGresser has posted a [17 part video series](http://www.monkeysee.com/play/995-how-to-make-pizza) on how she makes her pizza’s!

Awesome, I can’t wait to try my hand at making a pie. Baltimore has plenty of Italian deli’s that can be utilized to skip the laborious dough making process. We buy our pizza dough and other ingredients from [Di Pasquale’s](http://www.dipasquales.com/) in Highlandtown and when we are feeling lazy stay and have a neapolitan pizza from their brick oven.
