I’ll be at the annual [nerd convention](http://www.grantstavely.com/shmoocon-2008-tickets-ordered) all weekend. I’ve already made dinner plans for Friday. I don’t know what is up Saturday night for dinner, nor do I know if the Shmoo group has a Saturday night open bar planned like last year’s (which kicked ass). Sunday afternoon lunch is also already planned.

Anyone else going?
