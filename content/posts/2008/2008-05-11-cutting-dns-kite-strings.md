Verisign’s [SiteMinder](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&hs=Q7a&q=verisign+siteminder&btnG=Search) service was an abuse of their role and broke the internet.

But I would pay a DNS forwarder to redirect malware domains faster than they can be [kited](http://www.googleresearch.com/147).

Someone give [malwaredomains.com](http://malwaredomains.com/?page_id=6&wpcf7=json) some cash. Host it in [Amazon’s cloud](http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=201590011), follow [Cloudmark](http://www.cloudmark.com/") and give away content while selling integration software to Enterprises.

Invest in good IP space, something as memorable as 4.2.2.x

Google and Cisco are possible vendors, I predict Google will think of this first. They are naturally interested in the metadata. Right now they get your search terms, e-mail, IM, map addresses, and more – why wouldn’t they want to know every single domain name you resolve in real time?
