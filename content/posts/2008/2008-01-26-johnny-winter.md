I just bought two general admission tickets to see Johnny Winter
at The State Theatre in Virginia March 22nd.

I haven’t really listened to any recent Johnny Winter – I have _Second Winter_ and it’s great, but what really motivated me to grab tickets isn’t specifically his stuff (or that he played at Woodstock). Johnny brought Muddy Waters out of retirement to re-record using a mix of his band and Johnny’s band and the result, _Hard Again_, is the quintessential blues record of the 20th century.

What an opportunity!
