I grabbed 10 [Shmoocon](http://shmoocon.org/) tickets this year, and that was forgetting two people.

[Last year](http://www.grantstavely.com/shmoocon-olpc-talk) our group was able to upgrade to a suite. Weâ€™ll be trying some smooth William Shatner moves to repeat the upgrade this year.

**UPDATE**: We waited too long to get hotel reservations and sure enough, the entire Marriott in Woodley Park is booked. We ended up getting rooms at the Washington Marriott, which is at 22nd and M St. NW. After SANS at the Woodley Marriott for a week last month I could use the upgrade / change of neighborhood.
