I am a “Certified IT Professional”, as of this morning. Just like you hear about on the radio advertisements! Yikes.

I’m on [on the list](http://www.giac.org/certified_professionals/listing/gcfa.php) and they published my 83% score on the test to become a [SANS Certified Forensics Analyst](http://www.giac.org/certifications/security/gcfa.php).

I took the class six months ago and procrastinated on taking the test. I shouldn’t have because the test was a new version and covered new information not in my books – I got a 90% on the last practice test I took. =/

**Do certifications matter?**

Well it depends, and because it depends, the entire debate is not that interesting to me. But, I’m certified now, so I have to confront it.

Does my certification matter? To who[?](#whom has fallen out of the vernacular and I don't care what you say "whom has fallen out of the vernacular and I don't care what you say") I dig that it validates that I can pass an open book, multiple-choice four hour exam in about an hour and forty minutes. I also dig that potential future people looking at my qualifications might give it some value.

Does it mean anything else? Will I add it to my e-mail signature and business cards?

Not really, and no.
