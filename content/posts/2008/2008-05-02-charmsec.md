I’ll be attending, and we already have a few committed guests so that it won’t just be Ben and I enjoying [Oliver Ales](http://www.thewharfrat.com/wharf_rat_baltimore_oliver_ales.html). We spend all day in front of four or five monitors in small rooms with no windows interacting with the folks in the cubes around us over instant messenger. It’ll be like that only with beer, and a much much better screen.

I stopped using a (quake) handle years ago, but we don’t expect everyone there to talk openly about where they work or what they do. For future meetups, check the official [CharmSec](http://electricfork.com/charmsec) page.
