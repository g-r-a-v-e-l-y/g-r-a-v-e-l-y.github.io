None of us have a truly [paperless office](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paperless_office). The entire idea is an unreal sales pitch. We do have an mostly paperless office.

Don’t think so? Look at [this governmental office scene](http://www.shorpy.com/node/4725) from the beginning of the 20th century. Those books are not decorative testimonials of owner style and taste to be discussed, or lent to visiting information workers, or even more rarely, referenced. Those filing cabinets are not full of contractual records preserved for compliance reasons. Well, they might have some of those, but mostly they are the operational raw data of the business, and in this place, of the government.

They are the file servers.

More than half the people in that photo are now, in fact, infrastructure. Reassemble this operation with modern equipment and they will be right-sized.

Look how nice those pieces of infrastructure dress for work! My, how low the cubical walls are, why it’s almost the revolutionary open floor plan style office I’ve read about tech companies using in so many business articles!

Are all the file drawers open as staging for the photo, or is that the actual equivalent of locking an open ~file folder~ directory?

Unrelated and cool: Note the ghosts in the farthest depth of the picture.
