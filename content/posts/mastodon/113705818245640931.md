p funny going through bad twenty year old posts on my silly old website converting them to their fourth or fifth text markup language this holiday break and running into so many broken links and embeds.

onion-on-belt taboos against both hotlinking and mirroring completely made sense at the time, but, now, guess what silly, it's all gone, we should have hard mirrored entire things we liked, if we liked them, even if only as time capsules
