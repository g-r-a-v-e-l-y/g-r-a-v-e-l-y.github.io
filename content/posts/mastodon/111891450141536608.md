one tell that this is good is that I immediately shazam'd it off of NTS's “Expansions” mix ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmpgnzoFwNQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmpgnzoFwNQ), which I now assume is named after the track (or suite) of the same name after this one on record), paused the mix and listened to it again, and then the everloving wife stormed over and asked when my music changed from good to bad and shut my door.
