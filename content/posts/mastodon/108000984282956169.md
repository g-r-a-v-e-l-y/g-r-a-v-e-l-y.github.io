never properly did a ZZ Top phase so I’ve been blasting Tres Hombres a lot and it is easily up there w/ Muddy’s "Hard Again" as a desert island blues record, but now I’ve got “Have Mercy! been waiting for the bus all day” DVD-logo-bouncing in my head [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnXSzgNe4xE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnXSzgNe4xE)
