upgraded the pizza oven to the new 'max' ooni, which is insanely huge, so that I could do this: make an NY style pizza with slices that are the "correct" size, and feed the family one-and-done.

throwing out the dough to 20" was easy, launching was easy, etc.

I set my expectations low but am very impressed w/ the first bake even though I dislike the dough I made, mostly nits with the fermentation, and I launched too hot
