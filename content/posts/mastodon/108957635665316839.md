i have aqara sensors everywhere ( [https://www.aqara.com/us/temperature_humidity_sensor.html](https://www.aqara.com/us/temperature_humidity_sensor.html)) including one outside (which it isn’t designed for, so it doesn’t compensate for being in direct sun. precise-ish, not accurate)

that said, line go up

maybe today, not as high? 🤞🏼
