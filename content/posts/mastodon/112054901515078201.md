The roadshow staff, in a vertical stripe polo shirt listens attentively. Between them, propped on a table, is three drawings mounted on a blue felt board. top center: the color pen and watercolor on paper of the original sofa background from the first season of Beavis and Butthead. Below left, a pen and paper drawing of Butthead. Below right, a pen and paper drawing of Beavis.The appraiser estimates the sofa to be $1,000, auction price, and the two drawings that are not colored to be $1,000 together, or $500 a piece.](/images/112054901223956856.png)
