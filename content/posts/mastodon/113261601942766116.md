my intent here, from the get go, was to use the starter for pizza dough but the bread was good enough and easy enough that I'll probably also be making it on the regular too (I'm already looking forward to having a loaf on hand the next time I make coq au vin)

I've already got a never-miss "water the house plants" Sunday morning ritual to add the starter to, and almost all of the equipment and techniques from pizza making transferred well
