Speaking of the continually amazing 500songs, episode 76: “Stagger Lee” by Lloyd Price ( [https://500songs.com/podcast/episode-76-stagger-lee-by-lloyd-price/](https://500songs.com/podcast/episode-76-stagger-lee-by-lloyd-price/)) is absolutely fascinating and one of the best.

“Ah you mean the Nick Cave song? Isn’t that a ‘traditional’ tune?" There's so, so much more to it.

Supplemental music should you choose to read the transcript rather than listen, or just want to hear even more: [https://www.mixcloud.com/AndrewHickey/500-songs-supplemental-stagger-lee/](https://www.mixcloud.com/AndrewHickey/500-songs-supplemental-stagger-lee/)
