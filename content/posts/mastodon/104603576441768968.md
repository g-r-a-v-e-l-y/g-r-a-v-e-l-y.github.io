furious I can’t afford to have this mailing address [https://www.redfin.com/CA/San-Francisco/69-Beaver-St-94114/home/1645669](https://www.redfin.com/CA/San-Francisco/69-Beaver-St-94114/home/1645669), I’d put “apartment 420” on the mailbox and make it my mailing address, it would rule and the USPS person would have to deliver a “nice” every time they delivered the mail, I’d sit on the stoop and wait
