I've only ever read one other collection of stories that was so well assembled I chased the editor before the various authors therein and that was Otto Penzler.

So, if Black Water looks fun to you (it was for me!), I also recommend Penzler's collections: "The Best American Mystery Stories of the Twentieth Century", "The Best American Mystery Stories of the Nineteenth Century", and "The Best American Noir of the Century" ( [https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/12471.Otto_Penzler?utf8=✓&sort=popularity](https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/12471.Otto_Penzler?utf8=✓&sort=popularity))
