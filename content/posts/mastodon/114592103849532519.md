a few of the people I follow are on a years-long usually dormant thread with a few dozen people that just post the most wild schematics and infographics at each other and if I could follow a thread I would follow that thread and if I could find it I would break my usual "don't be a reply guy" lurker mentality and post this amazing graphic at it even though I don't know any of them and don't know what the thread is for so i'm just gonna post it here and maybe start a new one for myself and you
