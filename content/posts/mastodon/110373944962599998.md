eleventh book, Emily St. John Mandel's "Sea of Tranquility” ( [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45754981-the-glass-hotel](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45754981-the-glass-hotel))

More of a novella really, and while I have a pithy "oh it's like this" comparison I'll resist sharing the spoiler. I will say that I wish I'd read her previous book, “The Glass Hotel” first because they seem to share characters.

Anyway, yeah, “Station 11” author, if you liked that you'll like this.
