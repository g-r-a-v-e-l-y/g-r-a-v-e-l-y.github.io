ok, what the letters spells out is p easy to find on tvtropes[.]org which I'm told is a terrible website that'll rot your brain and your ability to perceive art as anything but strings of gimmicks (they probably have a name for people like me who believe this), so I guess if you look for it the right way, like I did, the answer is in the google preview (remember when things were like that?) and you don't have to click through.

but I'm also not gonna say what it is either, just read the book.
