I don't know many Verlaine stories but this one on Pushing Ahead of the Dame about Bowie's cover of "Kingdom Come" on Scary Monsters has stuck with me since it was posted (there's a similar story about Jimmy Page in the early 80s spending most of an invite on wah pedal battery fussing and not really laying anything down): everybody has off days.
