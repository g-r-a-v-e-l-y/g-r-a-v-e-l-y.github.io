Announcer: Thirty parents in SF agree.

Parents: [in unison] The Junction in Mill Valley is ideal!

Parent gravely: They have a damned pirate ship!

[The parents all nod in agreement]

Unnamed older parent: The beer garden vibe is also nice.

[The parents nod in agreement and toast their drinks]

Parent gravely: It's a too bad there's nothing like it in San Francisco!

[The parents continue to nod in agreement]
