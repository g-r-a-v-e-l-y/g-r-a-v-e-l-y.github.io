Hosting my kid's birthday party yesterday answering a friend’s question, "so how do you know all of these kids?"

“Well that kid is so and so, they went to pre-school together. And that kid is so and so, they are in TK together. That kid in the red shirt is, ah, jeeze, a friend’s kid who we see all the time but I'm completely blanking on their name"

She says, “Yeah, that's so and so.”

I say, "right, I forgot.”

Then I realize I'm talking to the kid in the red shirt’s mom.
