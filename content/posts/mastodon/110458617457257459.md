joked to myself the other day â€œwow it must have been windy last night" as I passed the flattened flex-post on east-bound 17th at Gus's, but it's been that way since at least January.

this is what passes for a compromise on the city's bike network map ( [https://www.sfmta.com/maps/san-francisco-bike-network-map](https://www.sfmta.com/maps/san-francisco-bike-network-map))

this morning I watched someone slowly drive over it, front left wheel, back left wheel, to park, ðŸ™ƒ
