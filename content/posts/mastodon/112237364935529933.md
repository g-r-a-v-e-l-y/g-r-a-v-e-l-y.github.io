🏁 what I'm considering Glen Park and Diamond Heights, bound by Portola, Diamond Heights Blvd, San Jose, Bosworth, and O'Shaughnessy Blvd

🏁 what I'm considering Potrero Hill, bound by Division, 280, Cesar Chavez, and 101


![A San Francisco street map centering the area bound by Market, 3rd street, 280, and Twin Peaks, on which most streets have a meandering purple GPS path I’ve logged on it, generally completing (in order I walked it) Noe Valley, Bernal Heights, the Inner Mission, Mission Dolores, the Castro, Eureka Valley, Glen Park, Diamond Heights, and Potrero Hill.](/images/112237364609082272.png)
