üèÅ what I'm considering Mission Dolores, Castro, and Eureka Valley, bound by Market, Valencia, and 20th.

Glen Park next for real this time, I think. Or Potrero Hill. Maybe both.


![A San Francisco street map centering the area bound by 101, 280, and Market, on which every street has a meandering purple GPS path I‚Äôve logged on it, generally completing (in order I walked it) Noe Valley, Bernal Heights, the Inner Mission, Mission Dolores, the Castro, and Eureka Valley. (I think of the Castro north of market as Corona Heights or Duboce Triangle).Along the way this time I filled in lots of alleys I had skipped in Noe Valley because walking on Valencia is getting pretty tedious (and I‚Äôve lived on or a block off of it for 14 years).](/images/112033624835239123.png)
