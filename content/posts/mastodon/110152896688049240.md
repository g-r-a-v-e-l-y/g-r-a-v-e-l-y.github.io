I immediately take the car lane for the full block as soon as I see a car in the current bike lanes. “I got us a lane, come on in fellow riders, I think to myself”, and maybe I'm imaging it but I usually get a vibe of relief when the see another cyclist stuck in the bike lane realize that they can join me safely

(while on bad days I'll also mentally add, to myself, ”the people in cars will never respect you for following their rules, look out for yourself first”)
