I am a few classes into Hubert Dreyfus’s 2007 ”Man, God, and Society in Western Literature” Berkeley lectures ( [https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley_webcast_itunesu_461120619](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley_webcast_itunesu_461120619)).

The Internet Archive's advanced search can return RSS which podcast apps understand, but it seems like it it's for subscribing to new collections, not for turning collections into podcasts.

So I think this is the best I can do?
