finally checked biking up twin peaks off my list after a friend suggested I head up via glen park instead of the usual routes. it's the same climb (and I hate climbing) but gradual over 5 miles instead of bunched up in the last mile and a half.

then, since I was already in spandex (very rare!), I tacked on a normal bay loop for the miles
