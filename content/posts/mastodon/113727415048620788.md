🏁 what I'm considering Mission Bay and Dogpatch.

Being from Maryland, I wondered where Maryland Street, once I found, many years ago, that most of the state-named streets, are along the eastern side of the city here. Maryland St. specifically is right on the waterfront. But you can only get to a few blocks at a time between all the industry.

All of the visible sections of the Mission, Bernal Heights, Potrero Hill, Mission Bay, and Dogpatch streets (and most alleys but not all the weird driveways and private sections of old streets which are slowly returning) are marked with a purple trail.](/images/113727414800845282.png)
