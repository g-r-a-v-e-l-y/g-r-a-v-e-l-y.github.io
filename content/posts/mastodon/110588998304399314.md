people double park in the center turn lane between chavez and 22n on Sundays mostly, to go to [https://realitysf.com](https://realitysf.com) or when the lot overflows at the [https://www.driscollsmortuary.com](https://www.driscollsmortuary.com)

afaik there is no legitimate other reason for the center lane to even exist. Lefts from Valencia are not causing traffic jams like lefts off of east bound Cesar Chavez do

Given they can just as easily double park on the new death-lane, why didn't the city extend the death-lane to Mission??
