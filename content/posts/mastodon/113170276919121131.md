I tend to buy clothes on ebay rather than dealing with retailâ€”like thrifting with less effort and better selection (especially for bright colors and patterns). On the way to getting some other thing, I ended up impulse buying a pair of broadcloth pajamas and now I'm Ricky Ricardo morning-or-evening-scene pilled

they are made of the same-ish material as bed sheets and the fit is very oversized so it feels like being in bed still. definitely beats the old sweat-pants-and-a-t-shirt thing i m o
