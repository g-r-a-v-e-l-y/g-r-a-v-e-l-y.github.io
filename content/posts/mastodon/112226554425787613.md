took junior to hike the sign

that's right

SOUTH

SAN FRANCISCO

THE INDUSTRIAL CITY

pretty nice, always wanted to do that.

it's a little 2 mile loop with a steep stepped shortcut up from the bottom to the top. also, you can walk on the letters. also also, if you bring cardboard you can slide on a few of them even.
