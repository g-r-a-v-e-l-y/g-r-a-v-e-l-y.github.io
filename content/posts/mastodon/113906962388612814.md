Aesop’s “The Boy Who Cried Wolf And Was Told By The Farmers On The Embankment, Oh, You're Surprised There's A Wolf? You're Tending Sheep, Didn't You Read that Article In The Atlantic Last Year About This? Here Is A Link It Will Only Take You Fifteen Minutes To Read Oh By The Way It Looks Like The Wolf Ate Your Whole Flock, That Is Really Unfortunate And We Sure Do Hate It.”
