eleventh book of 2024: "Trust", by Herman Diaz. ( [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58210933](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58210933))

Insulting to anarchists. "Obama liked this!" should have turned me away, but i was a fool.

Meh. Almost DNF'd about â…” of the way through but I'm on vacation and had an hour to slog through.

On the bright side, when I drop it off at one of those little free libraries maybe someone will have left a classic I can trade up for.
