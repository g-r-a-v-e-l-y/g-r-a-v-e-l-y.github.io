Oh, your team has a ‘war room ‘? Cute, if war is your thing, I guess.


![I couldn’t get anyone to stop using the term “War Room”, so I applied a little wa-ethic. Pictured is the hokey sign I blindly approved facilities posting on ours, which says “WAH ROOM”, In the event of an (sic) SIRT Emergency this room will be taken offline. Until then please enjoy as usual.](/images/13210337.jpg)
