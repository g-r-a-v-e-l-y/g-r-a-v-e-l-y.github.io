my favorite two gimmicks from Steve Conrad’s shows ( [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4687882/](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4687882/) and [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8912384/](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8912384/)) is that he has his characters call each other by first name a lot, and a lot of responses are just “Cool.” So if I say “Cool.” that’s what I’m doing.
