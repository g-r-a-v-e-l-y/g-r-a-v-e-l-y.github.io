🚶🏽‍♂️

🏁 what I'm considering The Excelsior.

Lovely neighborhood of sidewalk gardens and views. Dipping into McLaren Park for the final few east side walks was a nice bonus. Getting there on the 14 or 49 or BART was convenient but the time it took limited how often I could get any miles in on weekday mornings. Luckily the buses stop a block from my house and are running by 6AM those mornings.

Next: Outer Mission, or Portola?
