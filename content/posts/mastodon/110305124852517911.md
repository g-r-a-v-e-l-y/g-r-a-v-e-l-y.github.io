i've got a saved search on ebay for levis cords in my size - works great, already snagged a pair in an out-of-production color that i'm wearing in one of my pinned posts

anyway, today's hit is fun for two reasons: 1) I've never seen this red pointer before and love it, 2) it looks like someone blew the back out of these things?

I'm gonna pass on them
