finally figured out no-handing on the cargo bike: simply allow the tires to run a little low, simple as.

I'd been maintaining it like my commuter bike at max recommended pressure (60PSI I think), but at 40, the ride is a lot smoother and no-handing is easy.

Yay!


![my (rider) POV of no-handing a cargo bike, southbound on Shotwell, in the Mission, SF, U.S.A. Shotwell is a "slow street", through traffic is in theory prohibited but in actuality, only slightly discouraged. The cyclocomputer is registering about 15 miles per hour.](/images/109711292709678463.jpeg)

![same POV and speed as previous shot, on 17th st westbound, passing Jackson Park and Thee Parkside. Jackson Park is being completely redone next year and so they are topping all the trees that line the park to pre down to 10' stumps. It's a bummer, but the new park should be great... in 2026.](/images/109711319237610498.jpeg)
