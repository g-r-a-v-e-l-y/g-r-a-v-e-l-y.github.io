24: "Mickey7”, by Edward Ashton ( [https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250275035/mickey7](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250275035/mickey7))

picked up after a friend who had already enjoyed it linked [https://x.com/mickey17movie/status/1836197947668860958](https://x.com/mickey17movie/status/1836197947668860958) in discord, very fun, read it in a few days.


![Discord chat log review from a friend, who, now that I’ve read the book, I’m not sure I agree with re: “its about capitalism”, but it’s definitely about a guy whose job sucks, and it gets a pretty good chapter-long jab in at libertarians which is always vital to the revolution.Screenshot reads:Mickey 7 is a fun read, it's about capitalism and a guywhose job sucksI mean the director did Parasite](/images/113296285427881371.png)

![The cover of Mickey7 on paperback, as I read it (almost, I got my copy far enough along that it has “soon to be a major motion picture” on it too)An astronaut is on a spacewalk over a ringed gas giant w/ a nondescript moon over a mostly dark nebula filled star field (which has nothing to do with the story and is kinda hokey but “look at me I’m Science Fiction” gets the job done I guess. The title “MICKEY” is in white along the top with a particle effect that everyone seems to be doing (which makes sense on like, 4k+ TVs to show off but otherwise is just kinda a sand look or snow? idk), while in the center taking half the height of the cover is the number 7, author name in smaller print along the bottom. ](/images/113296285744680747.jpeg)
