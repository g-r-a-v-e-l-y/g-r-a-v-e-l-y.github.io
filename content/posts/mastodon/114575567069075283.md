at the picture shop a few days ago getting a julian lage sf jazz residency poster framed (I caught the solo acoustic show and the duo with marc ribot, who is just the coolest üòç) and while I was trying to decide on a ready-made or not, the other table became the center of attention w/a full size (huge) star wars poster, which looked mint.

the owner helping him says he worked at lucasfilm in the 80s and that this was one of two sizes or something? he was very excited


![a normal sized (18x24‚Äù) poster for Julian Lage‚Äôs SF Jazz residence in dark blue, dark green, and maroon over cream featuring an abstract guitar, a telecaster control set, flowers, and a hand holding a pen for some reason.I was trying to decide between the closest wood I could get to an acoustic guitar, and a metal that in hindsight looks a lot like fret wire. the metal was 1/3rd the cost of the wood, so I went w/ the metal."Julian‚Äù is horizontal in a script font on the left in red and LAGE is in all block sans in blue and green. the bottom left corner lists the dates and says:plays 4 nightssoloduo????](/images/114575566435261266.jpeg)

![a giant table-covering poster labeled ‚ÄúSTAR WARS REURN OF THE JEDI SERIES B ONE SHEET‚Äùwhich had been stored rolled, never folded, and in mind condition, I assume for 42 years (circa 1983) but maybe a repro?This is one of the illustrated headshot ones with darth vader in front of the second death star top center, luke under him, han under that, and the rest of the cast horizontal below Junior and I just happened to watch this one last weekend and it is pretty hokey, but the people in the store were all pretty excited by it. ](/images/114575566814132303.jpeg)
