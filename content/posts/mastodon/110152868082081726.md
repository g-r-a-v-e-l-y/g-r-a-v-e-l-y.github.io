here's a tag you can mute, no hard feelings, ok cya later: [#BicyclingInSanFrancisco](https://mastodon.social/tags/BicyclingInSanFrancisco)

the new valencia bicycle lane design is effectively an upside down muni track painted green down the center. I expect cyclists to eat shit when they try to enter or exit it mid-block just like we already eat shit when we have to ride parallel to them.
