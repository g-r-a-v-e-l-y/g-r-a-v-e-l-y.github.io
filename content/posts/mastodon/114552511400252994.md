watching a waymo creep in a crosswalk on howard parallel to me like a human would, even with probably-misplaced confidence that it is doing to so to

1) get a right on red, but for my walk

2) not be blocked by peds crossing when the light changes

3) drive more like a human so that the human drives behind it don't lose their god damned minds that the person in front isn't off the line on the green

4) because it is probably ultimately more efficient overall for the system

5) training
