At a client of mine's in the early 00s:

“Wow, hotdog stand. I’ve never seen anyone choose this, do you like it?” I asked.

"No. I don't know why it's like that. I came in one day and there it was.”

"Do you want me to change it back to normal colors?”

"No, don't change it!” they demanded, weirdly urgently.

“OK.”

They were later fired for conspiring w/ an IT support worker to embezzle a bunch of money. The IT worker even went to jail.

That client? Novavax.
