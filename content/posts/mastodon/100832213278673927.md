Last night the everloving wife goes to make some tea, so she opens the kitchen cabinet and there, along with all the other tea and coffee cups, she sees a full cup of coffee.

Apparently, Zombie Gravely likes his full cups off coffee snuggled with the empty cups, for safe keeping, in order to “protect them from the cat” and it is now the talk of the entire peninsula for this peculiar behavior.
