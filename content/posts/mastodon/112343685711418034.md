probably incredibly naive, making almost no attempt to map what I want to achievability, what I'd prefer is a municipalized neighborhood services plan where districts can establish their own priorities for rubber-stamp retail distribution so that I can open my pizza parlor as a city worker and union member (well, I'd be in management, so idk)

implementation could box rent seekers out out by acquiring all the retail property in neighborhoods and then sprinkling planned retail back into them
