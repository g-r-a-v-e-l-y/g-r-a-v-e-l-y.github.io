Very small sample size but: I overshot kneading on one of two dough balls by 10 degrees to mid-80s F, so when I placed them in my fermenting tray (and flattened them out given I had so much space to work with, so that they would cool more evenly), I marked that one.

After cold fermenting, the too-warm dough was slightly smaller, visually, than the correctly kneaded dough.

Go figure.
