The New York Trilogy was on the reading list for a Detective Fiction course I took in college (lovely course!) and, because it’s so great, I'm sure I don't have that copy on my shelf anymore because I foisted it on someone with "you have to read this” after one of the re-readings I’d given it since then.

RIP Paul Auster.
