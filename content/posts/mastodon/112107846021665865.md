seventh book of 2024: “Titanium Noir", by Nick Harkaway ( [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62052321-titanium-noir](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62052321-titanium-noir)). What it says on the tin and knows it. Spoonfuls of chewy metaphors.


![cover of “Titanium Noir”, by Nick Harkaway, as I read it, hardback (which is black). Black block stencil TITANIUM along the top over a black stencil fedora containing a shiny metallic head, dripping onto more black stencil NOIR over a brilliant green field. The authors name and other blurb elements including a quote from William Gibson are in a monospace console font.](/images/112107845774310785.jpeg)
