seventh book: "Good Strategy Bad Strategy: The Difference and Why It Matters" by Richard P. Rumelt.

Read this one for work and had a few people I'm “doing strategy” at work with read it too. They generally like it a lot so far.

I’m a big hater of most business (generally: airport) books full of hindsight, anecdote cherry picking and etc. This one has all of those things, but reads more like a memoir, which helps a lot. Anyway, I finished it. Parts were good, even.
