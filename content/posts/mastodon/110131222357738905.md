That afternoon, walking in the garden, the prince came face to face with Death. "Why," he asked, "did you make a threatening gesture at my gardener this morning?" "It wasn't a threatening gesture," answered Death. "It was a gesture of surprise. I saw him far from Ispahan this morning and I knew I must take him in Ispahan tonight."
