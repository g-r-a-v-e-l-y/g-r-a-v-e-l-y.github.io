tenth book, Matt Ruff's “Lovecraft Country” sequel, "The Destroyer of Worlds" ( [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61190257-the-destroyer-of-worlds](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61190257-the-destroyer-of-worlds))

I've been a huge fan of Ruff since “Sewer, Gas, and Electric" ( [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/71846.Sewer_Gas_and_Electric](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/71846.Sewer_Gas_and_Electric)) and of course the Lovecraft Country show was also p good (although a bit scary for my tastes), so, picking this up after Novel Explosions was a great call.


![The current hardback edition cover of Destroyer of Worlds, designed to look like a distressed pulp paperback printed directly on the cover rather than using a dust jacket (yay, I hate futzing with dust jackets)](/images/110175473492067408.jpeg)
