made my first sourdough country bread ( [https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/pain-de-campagne-country-bread-recipe](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/pain-de-campagne-country-bread-recipe), [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL6ogX38NcY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL6ogX38NcY)) yesterday after following instructions from King Arthur to make my own starter ( [https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/sourdough-starter-recipe](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/sourdough-starter-recipe)), after [@skinnylatte](https://hachyderm.io/@skinnylatte) mentioned how good PJ Hamelâ€™s recipes are ( [https://hachyderm.io/@skinnylatte/113105640187688460](https://hachyderm.io/@skinnylatte/113105640187688460))

plenty of room for improvement, but very much not bad!
