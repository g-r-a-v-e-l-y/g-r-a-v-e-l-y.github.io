did a little 20 mile bike loop from the mission mission to glen park, lake merced, sunset dunes park, gg park, doubled back to the pump track + skills track to meet the fam (the plan all along)

jr pushed his scooter around the skills track boards for a bit, we hung out on the logs further north, then they went home and I continued on through GGP and the wiggle

just by a rough eyeball count of blue “stand with joel” vs yellow “recall engardio” signs on the houses facing the GH, joel is doomed


![my bike, rolled up off the path onto the ice plant, leaning against a logit’s an ~10 year old gravel bike w/ slicks on it (an all-city macho man with disc breaks and 105 components) red on the front half and white on the back, with a buncha stupid stickers on the white half. I’ve got two water cages on it use both, a panier rack and bag.](/images/114576659206148766.jpeg)
