working on learning to play Pancho and Lefty this with thumb and fingerpicks like Townes turned into "I wonder if there's any Townes stuff on bandcamp?” (there is, including this Live at the Old Quarter release) turned into falling in love w/ the label, Fat Possum Records,’s ( [https://fatpossum.com](https://fatpossum.com)) motto (p good merch too):

“We're Trying our Best."


![Pic of a record I just took out of the carboard shipping box it’s laying on, on my kitchen island. Townes Van ZandtLive at The Old Quarter, Houston, TexasI ripped the clear plastic shrink wrap off as per, but laid it back on to get a pic of the label’s round sticker on it, which proclaims FAT POSSUM RECORDS and their .com in gold on black around the outter edge, and “We’re Trying Our Best” in a cute retro black on gold in the center, with the grocer’s quotes and everything.](/images/114617178161917327.jpeg)
