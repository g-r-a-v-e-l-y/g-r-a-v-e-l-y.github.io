this thing is chock full of software upscaling a la “Let It Be”, and that's certainly a choice. I know this pisses lots of people off (like normalization, autotune, drum machines, etc) and I'm not gonna tilt at it, it's just a thing people are doing right now.

I think it's ok to be mad at the dip in quality between film and digital and not want to present it in 320 lines of blur. I don't think this is a "let people enjoy things" take.
