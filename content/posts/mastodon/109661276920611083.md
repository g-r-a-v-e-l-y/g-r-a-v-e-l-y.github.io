first book of the year down, (I think via [@leigh](https://ottawa.place/@leigh) somewhere?): "Axiomatic," a collection of Greg Egan's short stories that appeared in various science fiction magazines (mostly Interzone and Asimov's) between 1989 and 1992.

Great late 80s hard SF shorts

I don't do star reviews, but, folks, they're good stories

aside: a characters is mentioned to have received their advanced degree in 2023, which I'm sure felt reasonably far out at the time.
