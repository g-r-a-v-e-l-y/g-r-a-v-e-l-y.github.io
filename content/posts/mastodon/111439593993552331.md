decided to try SFMTA's recommended southwest route ( [https://www.sfmta.com/maps/san-francisco-bike-network-map](https://www.sfmta.com/maps/san-francisco-bike-network-map)) today: climbed up chavez to tag slow sanchez, then back down to san jose, arlington, hearst, halloway, south around lake merced, and cruised up the great highway to the windmills to head home through the park, wiggle, etc.

Lovely!
