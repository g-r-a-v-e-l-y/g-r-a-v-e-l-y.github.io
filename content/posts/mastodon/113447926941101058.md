Link uses the term manichaeism in this interview and I don't know it but didn't look it up because I wanted to keep reading. then this morning I'm reading [https://inthesetimes.com/article/former-left-right-fascism-capitalism-horseshoe-theory](https://inthesetimes.com/article/former-left-right-fascism-capitalism-horseshoe-theory) and it's got manichaeism used too.

Dang. so I go pop open [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manichaeism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manichaeism) and from there eventually land on [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogomilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogomilism), which, haha, explains the last Link novel's name for one of the characters, “Bogomil.”, which I let slide when I read that.

I'm a very, very credulous reader. "Oh, ok, whatever.”
