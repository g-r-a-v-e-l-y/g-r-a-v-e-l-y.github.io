Worked my way up to a jogging a full mile over the past few weeks and, I guess my form was wrong, or my body wasn't ready in spite of all the walking I do. I didn't notice any one bad move but when I tried to repeat the mile jog a few days later and couldn't make it a block.

By the weekend, I had to bail a mile into a simple walk, and I've paused walks and strength training for at least a week while whatever is going on calms down.
