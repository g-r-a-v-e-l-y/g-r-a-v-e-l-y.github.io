I love that Joe Esk is bird dogging Mark F.'s (hiss) listing on the ballot as a ‚Äùsmall business owner" ( [https://missionlocal.org/2024/06/ballot-designation-marandidates-small-business-owner-superbooty/](https://missionlocal.org/2024/06/ballot-designation-marandidates-small-business-owner-superbooty/)).

I also noticed today that Mission Local's excellent "Meet the Candidates" (e.g. [https://missionlocal.org/2024/06/meet-district-5-candidates-week21-safe-consumption/](https://missionlocal.org/2024/06/meet-district-5-candidates-week21-safe-consumption/) ) series puts "Job" at the top of the bio-list.
