introduced to Amos Tutuola's "The Complete Gentleman" ( [https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/11169484-the-complete-gentleman](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/11169484-the-complete-gentleman)) via "Black Water 2." Tutuola's novel "My Life in the Bush of Ghosts" is what Brian Eno and David Byrne's 1981 album is named after, which i did not know about and now would like to read.

i can't find you a copy but here's a fun analysis: [https://www.tor.com/2018/12/19/i-aint-got-no-body-amos-tutuolas-the-complete-gentleman/](https://www.tor.com/2018/12/19/i-aint-got-no-body-amos-tutuolas-the-complete-gentleman/)
