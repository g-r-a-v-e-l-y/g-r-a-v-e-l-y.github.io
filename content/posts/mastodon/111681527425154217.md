First book of 2024: Ellen Ullman, "Close to the Machine: Technophilia and Its Discontents” ( [https://www.goodreads.com/book/486625/questions](https://www.goodreads.com/book/486625/questions)).

I don't know how this made it onto my pile but it was a quick read (I started it yesterday). It's so weird to read 90s tech memoirs. People were still sorta building stuff back then, weren't sure where things would end up, and so on.
