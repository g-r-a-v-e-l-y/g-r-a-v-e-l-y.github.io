have been watching a pile of Harris's studentâ€™s. TILFBH specifically gells with me, and so I've watched and re-watched the first few [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebepc8lYrKs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebepc8lYrKs) without an instrument, or with an instrument but not a metronome, just kinda singing or playing along as I watch, trying to hear the secondary dominant (the C#), and the Major stuff and so on

today I felt ready to pickup a guitar and dig out my metronome for the first exercise here, the blues
