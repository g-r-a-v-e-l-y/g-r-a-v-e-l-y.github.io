kinda worry that sonos is never going to re-add direct stream urls to their first party apps or even fix the players to load the ones that are already there, and that think the fix is going to be a DIY sonos service app and not entire DIY controllers, which, unfortunately, seems to be the bias

they are, otherwise, goldilocks pieces of hardware for my specific preferences, so broader alternatives are not interesting
