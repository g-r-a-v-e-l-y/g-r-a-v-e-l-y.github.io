heather k, please help

our small business owners are being fattened on ice cream sugar cones, fudgesicles, rainbow sherbert pops, swirl lollys, and pastel mints and then gobbled up by witches whose houses are painted with those delicious treats and nobody is talking about it

please amplify this for your audience at the new yawk times, thanks in advance
