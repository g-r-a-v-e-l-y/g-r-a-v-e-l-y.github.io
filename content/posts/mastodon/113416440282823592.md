it's really clever how oven makers put the big stock pot burners on the back so's when you accidentally pull your entire salt cellar out of the upper cabinet next to the stove with an errant finger while trying to get a pinch in a hurry for something else and about two cups of kosher salt dump all over the stovetop, counter, floor, etc, none of it gets in the stock pot with dinner in it
