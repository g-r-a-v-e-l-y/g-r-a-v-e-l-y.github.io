haven't cut my hair in over a year except for one straight DIY shear pass mid-year on the back to de-mullet

everyone who asks and finds out what I'm doing is all “I couldn't get through the awkward phase" and I'm all “well, tbh? it's all awkward, with brief OK phases"

beat

also everyone who has ever had long hair when I complain about it: “well you could always cut it off, I don't regret going that at all" and I'm like “you are right.”

beat

so I think I'll keep growing it out another year
