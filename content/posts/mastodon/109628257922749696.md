does the fact that I got out a 6' ladder and traversed the wall between our units to clear out the neighbor's clogged patio drains ahead of tomorrow (they are out of town) absolve me of putting our christmas tree out on the sidewalk tonight (which to be clear I haven't done yet) where it will surely float away in the storm tomorrow and disrupt commerce on Valencia St or nah?
