fourth book of 2024: "Mismatch" ( [https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262539487/mismatch/](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262539487/mismatch/) ) subtitled "How Inclusion Shapes Design" by Kat Holmes ( [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39644200-mismatch](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39644200-mismatch)).

I grabbed this one after landing on a Don Norman piece ( [https://www.fastcompany.com/90338379/i-wrote-the-book-on-user-friendly-design-what-i-see-today-horrifies-me](https://www.fastcompany.com/90338379/i-wrote-the-book-on-user-friendly-design-what-i-see-today-horrifies-me)). I enjoyed “The Design of Everyday Things" so I followed Norman's suggestion to read Mismatch.

Pretty quick read, and full of things so obviously correct that I got impatient with the author's patience? Good stuff.


![The paperback cover of Mismatch as I read it. Black helvitca on white title, subtitle, author, foreward author, left-aligned-on-center, top third. a design that reads like the 70s/80s trend of “generic” stuff, The bottom half is a black swirl stroke broken into 8 textures: blot, spikes, dots, bands, checkerboard, circles, stripes, and brush.](/images/111874405744317165.jpeg)
