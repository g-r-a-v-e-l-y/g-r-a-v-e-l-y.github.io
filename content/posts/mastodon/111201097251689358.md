I skipped the damned introduction (as per. I don't read introductions first, they are for re-readers) and read it after, which is a lot of words to say some interesting things but mostly conclude that Walter Benjamin gets the closest to figuring Kafka out

so I've now got [https://docslib.org/doc/5900836/franz-kafka-on-the-tenth-anniversary-of-his-death](https://docslib.org/doc/5900836/franz-kafka-on-the-tenth-anniversary-of-his-death) open to maybe read, maybe abandon, at some later time, idk
