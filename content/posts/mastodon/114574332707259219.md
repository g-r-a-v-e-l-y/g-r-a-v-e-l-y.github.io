at least a band famously hostile to tapers (or passive to Peter Grant) and infamously noted for onion-on-belt songwriting credit lag didn't profit off of tapers I guess? weird decisions.

also, it is full of stock footage cultural contextualization, which, as a device, ugh, the worst dreck of romanticism imo.
