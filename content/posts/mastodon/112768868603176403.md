thanks to discord's hokey use of a command for command-K, officially â€œFind or Start a Direct Message" per their docs, I am always constantly narrowly avoiding direct messaging someone I do not know who has the last name of Jerke who I assume also idles in an open source community server I idle in, when I try to switch to the chat I made for talking about anything but games on my friend's gaming-oriented community server which they immediately renamed and locked to [#jerk_factory](https://mastodon.social/tags/jerk_factory) for me
