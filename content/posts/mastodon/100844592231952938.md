As a society, we need to bring back giving people the old hot foot. I'm talking about strike anywhere matches stuck in boots and then lit with more matches, all while breaking the fourth wall, chuckling quietly behind a hand and making shh-ing it's-our-little-secret-for-now motions, causing our victims to hoot and holler and jump up and down holding the hot foot.
