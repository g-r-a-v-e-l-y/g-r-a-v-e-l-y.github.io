this morning's spooky:

on my third walking tour of Sunnyside, listening to the excellent [https://cocaineandrhinestones.com](https://cocaineandrhinestones.com) episode on Rusty and Doug Kershaw ( [https://cocaineandrhinestones.com/rusty-doug-kershaw-cajun-way](https://cocaineandrhinestones.com/rusty-doug-kershaw-cajun-way)) which in a surprise twist to me ends up being very much also about Neil Young's On the Beach and Tyler Mahan Coe, the host, opens with a brief history of the acadian people and what's my first turn on the walk? Acadia Street. Whoa.
