texts like this are like the inverse of gell-mann amnesia, and the best ones (which this is? Idk I'm not that well read to say!) do so w/o degrading into the easier and tedious "we're all failing and need to do better‚Äù conference keynote gimmick simulation of it.

anyway, by which I mean, you read about an area of focus in another field and see the author clearly knows what they are talking about and moreover that the grievances they have align w/ the same grievances you have in your own field
