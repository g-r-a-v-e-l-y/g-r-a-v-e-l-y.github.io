I love views of downtown as I enter the city afar, and from hilltops and rooftops in the neighborhoods. But I always also imagine the following dialog with myself:

"Wow, hard to believe people built all that over there”

"Yeah, pretty neat! Do you want to go there? Maybe into one of those cool buildings?”

“Nope.”

“Do the people who live there like it?

"Nobody lives there.”

“OK, but at least the buildings are used to good stuff? Right?"

“No, not really.”
