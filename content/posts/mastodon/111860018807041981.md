third book of 2024: “Particle Theory", a collection of stories by Edward Bryant ( [https://reanimus.com/store/index.cgi?author=Edward%20Bryant](https://reanimus.com/store/index.cgi?author=Edward%20Bryant)).

I started this a while ago after reading an interview with Ted Chiang (maybe this one? [https://www.sfsite.com/09b/tc136.htm](https://www.sfsite.com/09b/tc136.htm)).

I really, really like Ted Chiang's stories. Ted really, really likes Bryant's stories. Some of these were quite good, some just OK. I stalled on it a few times.

”giANTS”, the one about ants, is one of the good ones ( [https://nebulas.sfwa.org/nominees/edward-bryant/](https://nebulas.sfwa.org/nominees/edward-bryant/)).

![the paperback cover of the currently available I-assume-reissue from reAnimus press, with a font that might as well be called “space ship” in gray over black top and bottom and a washed out early 90s 3D rendering of some chemical over a washed out face. It’s so great that 50 year old collections can get picked back up and run by groups like reAnimus, and I look forward to the software getting more sophisticated, because the printing was pretty simple (top of page author on the left, top of page book name on the right, rather than story name, for instance), if better looking overall than lots of presses like this.](/images/111860018555089813.jpeg)
