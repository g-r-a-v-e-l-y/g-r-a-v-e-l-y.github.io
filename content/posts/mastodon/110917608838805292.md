17th book of the year: "The Palm-Wine Drinkard" and “My Life in the Bush of Ghosts” by Amos Tutuola ( [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/303496.The_Palm_Wine_Drinkard_My_Life_in_the_Bush_of_Ghosts](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/303496.The_Palm_Wine_Drinkard_My_Life_in_the_Bush_of_Ghosts))

The story I enjoyed in Black Water 2 was an excerpt from “The Palm-Wine Drinkard” (which is subtitled “and his dead Palm-Wine Tapster in the Deads' Town)

I preferred the drinkard because more of the stories in it seem like little self-contained myths. And of course I'm glad to now have a connection back to the Byrne/Eno album that I love.


![current paperback cover of the plam-wine drinkard, and my life in the bush of hosts, flat orange on the top half and a green leaf motif on the bottom half with black text over both and abstract-ish opposing-half paper collage of what looks like an someone’s exquisite-corpse project (you can kinda make out a head on the top half and if that’s a head, maybe a body on the bottom half?) ](/images/110917608567733898.jpeg)
