second book down, the new Jason Pargin (f. k. a. David Wong), "If This Book Exists, You're in the Wrong Universe." It was fun! I lol'd a few times, didn't want to put it down, etc.

Jason put a tiny house of leaves gimmick in it (it's full of metafiction shit tbh) but I only noticed it was happening for the last word so if you read it, let me know what it says (I'm going to go cheat and google it right now).
