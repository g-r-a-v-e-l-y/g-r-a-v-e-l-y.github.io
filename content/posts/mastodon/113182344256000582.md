22: “Doppelganger: A Trip Into the Mirror World”, by Naomi Klein

Another one that I waited out thinking "eh, probably great but maybe I'll pass" and then people I follow just kept citing it months and months later, so onto the pile it went. My first and not last Klein book, about significantly more than I expected.

![the cover of doppelganger, as i read it (in hardback, with the dust cover set atop the to-read pile). All cover text is a white grotesque over a full color author photo that is glitched (kinda like my own profile photo) into a few dozen horizontal bands and distorted along red, green, and blue shifts our of horizontal sync to the left and right.
