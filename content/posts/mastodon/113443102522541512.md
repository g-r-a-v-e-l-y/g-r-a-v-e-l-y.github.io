looking up the chicago school of economics building to make a house of leaves jokes in chat and unsurprised to find it looks like a god damned church


![photograph of a brick church seminary on a partly cloudy day from 50 foot up looking down and across the entanceThe former Chicago Theological Seminary building located at 5757 South University Avenue was adaptively reused to house instructional and research programs for the Department of Economics and the office, conference, and research facilities for the Becker Friedman Institute for Research in Economics. The 100,770 gross square foot main building was renamed the Saieh Hall for Economics in June 2014. The renovation began in Fall 2012 and encompassed repairs and upgrades to the building envelope, HVAC and electrical and voice/data systems, and bringing the building infrastructure up to all required life/safety and accessibility codes. New space was constructed below grade for mechanical rooms and a large tiered lecture hall. To connect the east and west existing buildings at the ground level, a new building entrance was constructed by vacating the alley exiting to 58th Street. Construction was completed in June 2014. from: https://facilities.uchicago.edu/construction/5757south-university/](/images/113443102260747200.jpeg)
