So, I upgraded my pocketcasts subscription to a tier that supports hosting arbitrary files, downloaded all of the mp3s from the archive, uploaded them to pocketcasts on the web, found them on my phone (profile, files, sort by name) and off I go.

A little tedious and so-close but not there with just advanced search.

Alas.
