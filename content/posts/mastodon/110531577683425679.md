thirteenth book of '23, “Wilderness Station" ( [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25194123-a-wilderness-station](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25194123-a-wilderness-station)) by Alice Munro (previously issued as "Selected Stories” ( [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14281.Selected_Stories](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14281.Selected_Stories))).

Wow! Loved it.

The “Selected Stories” title has had time to be rated and critiqued by much more careful readers. Lots of comparisons to Chekov, who I suppose I'll check out next. I'll also definitely be getting the companion collection, Family Furnishings, Selected Stories 1995-2014.
