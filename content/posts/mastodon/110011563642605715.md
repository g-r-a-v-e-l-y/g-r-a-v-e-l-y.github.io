threading is getting fragile so I'm backing this out to the main thread: what I thought would be the fifth, sixth, or maybe seventh book of the year turned out to be my eight. Such is the tragic unpredictability of having a full shelf of in-progress and to-read nonsense.

Eighth book of the year: The Museum of Eterna's Novel (The First Good Novel) by Macedonio Fern√°ndez ( [https://www.rochester.edu/College/translation/threepercent/2010/12/01/museum-of-eternas-novel-the-first-good-novel/](https://www.rochester.edu/College/translation/threepercent/2010/12/01/museum-of-eternas-novel-the-first-good-novel/))

The Rochester "Three Percent" review closes with a lovely summary.
