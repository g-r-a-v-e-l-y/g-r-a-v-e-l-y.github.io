the everloving wife and I made about an eighth of the way around Stow Lake in Golden Gate Park with junior and my dad in the back seat yesterday (so about 650 pounds passenger load) in one of those little peddle boats before my legs said to turn around

Lovely to be on the water but I’m definitely getting a row boat next time. The "bike seat height" equivalent is bottomed out so my legs barely made it past 90 degrees at extension. I'm about 6’0”.
