entering my Townes Van Zandt era even though lyrics normally pass over my smooth brain like the colored smoke over an efficient wing in wind tunnel tests reminds me of getting into Elvis Costello years ago and telling a hipper friend of mine "wow, did you know his first few albums are like, incredible?" and getting in response a very deadpan “yes, that is generally the consensus.”

late-mid-century texas and bakersfield sounds are my jam lately, catching me by surprise.
