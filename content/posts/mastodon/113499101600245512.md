the actual work of getting it to build was mostly fighting with the cruft of fads and new-things (shtml, textpattern, wordpress, octopress, etc) and incredible journeys ( [https://ourincrediblejourney.tumblr.com/](https://ourincrediblejourney.tumblr.com/)) and stuff I'd divested from over whatever reasons seemed sufficient at the time. Oh, we are all protest-deleting our github accounts now? Ok, I can do that. Oh, flickr got acquired and is being weird? Cya. tumblr too? bummer.
