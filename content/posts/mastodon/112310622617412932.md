13th book of 2024: "Bliss Montage", by Ling Ma ( [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60243188-bliss-montage](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60243188-bliss-montage)").

I forget why this got my attention but I will cop to the "by the author of Severance" blurb helping more than somewhat, not realizing that it's a novel that predates the show by four years and is completely unrelated to it.

What a lovely mistake! The stories were excellent and I will probably grab the novel too. Warning: maybe check the content before starting on the first two stories?
