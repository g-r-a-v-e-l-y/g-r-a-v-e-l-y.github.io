junior's TK teacher gave him a old craft mobile in a book from 1983 (when I was his age)


![a photograph of the book’s staple binding removed and the eight color printed card stock pages spread as four landscapes two by two over the fifth containing instructions, set on our our dining table in rows of two, two and one. I forgot to take a picture of the cover. Oops.the color pages contain shapes in primary colors, perforated so as to be punched out, and a map of how to assemble them into a mobile also visible are a few eames shell chairs in green, walnut, pink, and red,, a red cup of coffee, and a rubber plant in the corner](/images/112473567001684077.jpeg)
