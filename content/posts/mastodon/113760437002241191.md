I've been struggling to land on a good dough process without doing a bunch of math.

Lucky for me, I found a modern [Lehmann calculator]( [https://burner.com/pizza/calc/](https://burner.com/pizza/calc/)) (named after a forums poster, so you know the approach is good), and have had great luck with it, using bakers percentages a bit more like Kenji's at 60% hydration, 2% oil, 2% salt, 1% instant yeast.

I use cold water from the fridge and mix it using a food processor until it registers mid-70s F on a thermapen, then cold ferment.
