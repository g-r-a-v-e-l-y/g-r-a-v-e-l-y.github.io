this kinda stuff is better thought of as sets of idioms* in the it â€œcannot be understood from the individual meanings of its elements" sense than as whatever adjectives advocates like to throw around like "simple" or "clean" and so on

it is a skill to be able to onboard and adapt various idioms, I'm just coming at this pile of them a little cold I guess
