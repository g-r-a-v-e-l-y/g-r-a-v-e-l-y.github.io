[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lp_sjTfmJQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lp_sjTfmJQ) “One Moment Please” - Romaal Kultan - the soundtrack of me flipping from chat to tab to chat to tab to email to chat to thinking about dinner looking for my shoes in four places for the third time going back to chat, posting about RSA because it came to mind, hearing this song, that synth line making me anxious as hell, finding my shoes, shazaming the song, posting it, lol _gd_ that line is anxious, I gotta go for a walk
