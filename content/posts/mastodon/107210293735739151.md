listening to an old Dylan “Theme Time Radio” episode (because whoever wrote and picked for the show did _amazing work_ and most of the tunes are fun to play guitar with), and in this one he reads a letter from none other than Alan Dershowitz, haha ( [https://www.themetimeradio.com/episode-13-rich-man-poor-man/](https://www.themetimeradio.com/episode-13-rich-man-poor-man/))
