fresh mozz margs and proper (whole foods deli) peperoni for jr. trying to go as fast as I can: launch, go back inside, shape, go outside, turn, go inside, sauce, go outside, pull, etc.

~75-85 seconds at 900F

Also I got a bunch of aluminum plates at the right size for these so that I can to set the full size oven to warm and rack these as they come out so that and everyone gets warm pizza instead of cold
