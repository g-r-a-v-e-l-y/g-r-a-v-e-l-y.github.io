I left to meet the fam for 5pm dinner after this (DST delenda est).

The worker in charge (idk ranks) told me it smelled like paper burning and I agree. The garage was, from what i saw, mostly storage of somebody's stuff and not actively used for parking or w/e. Sorry somebody! That stinks.

And after, just this morning, walking past Cellarmaker as they cleaned up a broken plate glass window.

Bummer of a day!
