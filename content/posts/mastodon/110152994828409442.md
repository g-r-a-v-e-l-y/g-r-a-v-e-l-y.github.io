if your goal is zero deaths, this ain't it. if your goal is zero injuries, this definitely ain't it.

We already have this pattern northbound on Valencia at 14th (at Zeitgeist). I always assume I'm going to be killed here and take the car lane before the intersection if I can, I've seen too many rights on red bearing down on other cyclists here

it isn't the driver's fault, it's simply a design failure with band-aides. it relies on signs, paint, and enforcement.
