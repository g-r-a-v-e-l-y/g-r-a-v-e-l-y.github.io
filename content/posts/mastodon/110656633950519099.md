fifteen: Egan again. I knew I'd have a 10 hours of plane time, so I brought "Oceanic" ( [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6741362-oceanic](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6741362-oceanic)) and it delivered.

Egan's political and hard science (the bulk of this set) stories are my favorites while the atheist ones like the title story "Oceanic" are probably more interesting to previously religious people, which I never was. I've always found faith to be entirely inscrutable, so exploring losing it is kinda just more of that to me?
