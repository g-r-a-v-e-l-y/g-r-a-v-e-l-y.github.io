21st book of the year: “The Seven Moons of Maali Almeida”, by Shehan Karunatilaka

A friend posted that they'd just read a book that they think might be the best book they'd ever read, and it was this one. 4, 3, 2, 1 was listed for a Booker and this one won the prize? OK, I'll try it.

I really wanted to like it more than I did, and the second act really flows well, but I had a hard time finishing it, today, finally. It's right up my alley in lots of ways. v0v
