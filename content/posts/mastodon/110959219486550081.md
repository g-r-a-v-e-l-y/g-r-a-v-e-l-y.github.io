18th book of the year: "SPQR", by Mary Beard

Wanted to read some history after the last few things. Kept seeing Beard press over the years, saw she has a new book out and grabbed a used copy of her old stuff instead.

lotta "assassinated for tyranny after proposing social and/or land use reforms" Kermit-confused-face.bmp

lotta good stuff on how normal people lived

next up, the most recent Paul Auster, "4321", cya in like a month or two probably


![the paperback cover as i read it, title over author's name in black serif over white. the font is probably Trajan idk (haha). a crown (of gold laurel?) surrounds the titleINTERNATIONALBESTSELLERSPOR A HISTORYOF ANCIENTROME MARYBEARD'Beard succeeds triumphantly Sunday Times](/images/110959219224353615.jpeg)
