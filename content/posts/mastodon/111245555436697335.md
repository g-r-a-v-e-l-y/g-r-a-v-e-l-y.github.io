[http://www.online-literature.com/anton_chekhov/1289/](http://www.online-literature.com/anton_chekhov/1289/) Anton Chekhov on next-door-posting, every-day-carry types of 1898, “The Man in the Case” ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_in_the_Case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_in_the_Case))

Fun. I'm reading some light socialist realism, "Stalingrad”, by Vasily Grossman, and this story came up in reference with a footnote so I tracked it down.
