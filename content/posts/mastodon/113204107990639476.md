[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uMNrujMdJU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uMNrujMdJU) watching this old Barry Harris lecture w/ a jazz group he's teaching or rehearsing, and I'd always heard he was engaging but, wow. Not much chance I'm ever going to use this stuff but it has held my attention the entire time

this one is mostly about coming in on the and, not rushing, using triplets, and other things.

â€˜jazz used to be about dancing'
