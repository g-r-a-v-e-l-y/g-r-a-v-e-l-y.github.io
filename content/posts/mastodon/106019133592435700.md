Sunday: Nevil Shute, _On The Beach_ ( [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38180.On_the_Beach?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=8GoAXQibBz&rank=1](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38180.On_the_Beach?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=8GoAXQibBz&rank=1)) romantic fatalism? Not my thing! It was nice to remember Ballardâ€™s _The Assassination Of John Fitzgerald Kennedy Considered As A Downhill Motor Race_ in place of the races. I guess. Too dudes-rock for me.
