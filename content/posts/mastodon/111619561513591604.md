kindof a typical weekday: walk the kid to Flynn, continue on to try to hit blocks I've never logged walking, do about 5 miles, be back by 9-ish. But, today, I finally logged the last few blocks of Noe in the somewhat arbitrary bounds I established for myself to completion.

New bounds: from Caesar Chavez to 101 to 280 to San Jose Ave.
