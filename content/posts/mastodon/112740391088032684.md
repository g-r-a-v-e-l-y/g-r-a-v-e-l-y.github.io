I think if cars and car parts were stollen at the rates bikes are in U.S. cities, deployed technical controls would look a lot more like off-site valet parking than like racks on the sidewalk, and the compensating control would look a lot more like car insurance than like adding the car to your home insurance policy, and nothing at all like whatever the latest video from some guy in NYC posting how to use three specific locks in very specific ways
