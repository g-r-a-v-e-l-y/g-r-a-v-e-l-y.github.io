third book, "The Stories of your Life and others", Ted Chiang.

Cheating because I read the first half last year. I got another copy after leaving my first copy on a plane ( [https://mastodon.social/@gravely/109372422129728908](https://mastodon.social/@gravely/109372422129728908)).

I hope whoever found my first copy enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed my second copy.
