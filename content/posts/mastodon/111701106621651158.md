I like this thai basil recipe ( [https://shesimmers.com/2012/05/pad-ka-prao-%E0%B8%9C%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B0%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B2.html](https://shesimmers.com/2012/05/pad-ka-prao-%E0%B8%9C%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B0%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B2.html)) better than the one i used to use because it calls for fish, light soy, sweet soy, and oyster, instead of just fish sauce.

still a wimp with the birds tho
