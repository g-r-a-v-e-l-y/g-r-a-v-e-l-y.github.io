14th book of 2024: “The Iliad", by Homer, translated by Emily Wilson.

I really enjoyed Wilson's “Odyssey” and “Oedipus Tyrannos” translations and had hoped to get to this last fall when I put it on the to-read pile. Alas.

I've never read any The Iliad before, and it does kinda go on a bit (really? that's your thoughts on the Iliad? sure why not, is "it was good" better?).

Wilson manages to sneak in some slapstick amid all the brutality.
