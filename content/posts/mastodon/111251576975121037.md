the second funniest thing in the new yorker thing about san francisco was the grow sf people wearing their own swag

the funniest thing was the retiree calling a biz tax â€œpunitive", which, like, I'm not a lawyer, but, lol, lmao

> 0.175 percent to 0.69 (nice) percent on gross receipts for businesses with over $50 million in gross annual receipts, or

> 1.5 percent of payroll expenses for certain businesses with over $1 billion in gross annual receipts and administrative offices in San Francisco.
