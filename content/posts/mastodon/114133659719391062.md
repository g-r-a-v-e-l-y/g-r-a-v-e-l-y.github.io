this is all so stupid. I assume accessing http streams and favoriting them is not a revenue opportunity and thus prioritized somewhere below first party enlightenment sound daemon support, so the ‚Äúnew‚Äù mobile app hard-rake-staircase-ollie üôÑ (the designers did a great job, the engineering decisions worry me) still can't do what I've been doing for nearly fifteen years.

home assistant can, clumsily, so I faked up the old UI with four sonos cards each locked into single mode.


![The sonos mac app on my machine this morning. Sonos has used this hokey three column layout for a very long time. Left: speaker selection and grouping. center: now playing artwork over playlist. right: source services, media library, or favorites, currently displaying favorites.](/images/114133658782164351.png)

![home assistant using the synthwave theme (purple with pink headers and white text), with a music dashboard selected.left column: speaker selection. center: now playing artwork over playlist for the selected speakers. right: media selection showing ‚Äúbrowse media‚Äù (useless) and Favorites](/images/114133659156493594.png)

![the same dashboard on my phone, which collapses all of the columns into one, is incredibly silly, but works just fine for me, assuming I can trick myself into remembering to use it instead of opening the bad app first, which I tend to do.](/images/114133659472685525.png)
