was looking for a set of configuration params for something incredibly tedious to look up from scratch yesterday

I was pretty sure I'd temporarily had it in an unsaved sublime text tab and stumbled into sublime not only supporting "command-shift-T" to restore closed tabs but that I could keep going, back years in fact. Yikes. Wasn't there though.

Maybe iTerm? Sure enough: Session -> Open paste history, from three weeks ago.
