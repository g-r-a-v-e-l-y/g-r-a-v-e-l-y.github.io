20th book of 2024: “Killed by a Traffic Engineer”, by Wes Marshall ( [https://www.killedbyatrafficengineer.com](https://www.killedbyatrafficengineer.com)).

Lots of people read this last year when Marshall published it and the title was so catchy, I thought about it after the last few accidents in SF, which made me think I should go back and actually read it.

80+ three page ideas, lots of overlap with the incident management side of my day job, casually written (if a little too pop, even, but I guess that's ok).

Every field is like this, it seems.


![The paperback cover, as I read it, of “Killed by a Traffic Engineer”, by Wes Marshall. Title and author name in all caps grotesque, pitch in a standard case, all center aligned, title top, author name bottom right, pitch bottom left, white on black. In the center is a photograph of a stop sign that has been damage and the lower left corner bent out of shape, so that it only says O PRed spine, white text.KILLED BYA TRAFFIC ENGINEERO PShattering the Delusion that ScienceUnderlies Our TransportationSystemWESMARSHALL](/images/113020657875567966.jpeg)
