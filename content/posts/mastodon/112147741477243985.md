ninth book of 2024 (is counting like this annoying? idk, it's all one mutable thread, so, whatever): “Get in Trouble", by Kelly Link ( [https://kellylink.net/books/get-in-trouble](https://kellylink.net/books/get-in-trouble)).

More great stories, some of which, but fewer than those in "Stranger Things Happen" would fit right in with those collected in “Black Water” ( [https://mastodon.social/@gravely/110403938932091902](https://mastodon.social/@gravely/110403938932091902)) and “Black Water 2” ( [https://mastodon.social/@gravely/110899731695137550](https://mastodon.social/@gravely/110899731695137550)).


![the trade paperback cover of “Get in Trouble”, by Kelly Link, as I read it.An painted illustration of a small farm house in a clearing in a wood; a woman in a red shirt and jeans approaches the house up the front walk while two foxes approach from the left in front of a healthy fruit tree, the dead and leafless mirror of which is on the right. The entire illustration is upside down and the title, painted in call capital white handwriting over the sky is surrounded by and set on by black birds. ](/images/112147741225771522.jpeg)
