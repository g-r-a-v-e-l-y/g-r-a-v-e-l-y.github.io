growing my hair back out from a DIY #2 taper because I switched from gamer headphones to speakers and a mic don't have headphone-ring anymore.

I have no idea how to do anything that isn't a #2 taper, but I also don't care how it looks so I think if I just start at my neck / ears instead of my part, it'll work the same
