i'm constantly flip flopping things in my imagination and honestly it's kinda intrusive and annoying but also some people clearly do not and cannot and it's so weird imaging their world

the typical stuff:

looking at a young person and imagining them older, even much older

seeing an old person and reminding myself that they were once my age, once in high school, or elementary school

gender presentation alternates

etc
