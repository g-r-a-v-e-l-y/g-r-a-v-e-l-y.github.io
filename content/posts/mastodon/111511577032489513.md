junior is watching a lot of the 1960s Spiderman cartoon lately, which has pretty catchy music that it maybe relies on a bit too much: like it's always playing one of three for our themes

now, I only know those themes from King Megatrip mixes from twenty years ago ( [https://megatrip.blogspot.com/2021/02/king-megatrip-mixtapes-2000-2002.html](https://megatrip.blogspot.com/2021/02/king-megatrip-mixtapes-2000-2002.html)), who fell out of my syndication subs at some point and I've now fixed.
