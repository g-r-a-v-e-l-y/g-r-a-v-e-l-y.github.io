Moved a few afternoon meetings to make the last hour and a half of Kid Koala at SF MOMA's ‘Art of Noise’ exhibition. I'm a huge fan from way back, was amazing!

Normally a phone-in-pocket-guy at shows but, he put on on John Carpenter's soundtrack to Big Trouble Little China to play a bit of "Pork Chop Express" and I had to send proof back east to brag.
