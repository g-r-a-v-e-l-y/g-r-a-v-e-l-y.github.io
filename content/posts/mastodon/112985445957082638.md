🏁 what I'm considering "the rest of Eureka Valley", Clarendon Heights?, Upper Market, and Midtown Terrace. I'm gonna have to come back for the interior of Laguna Honda.

I've bee consistently pecking away since my last post in April, but for most of them I need to "get there" first which makes it harder to do in the morning. I’d rather bike when I have that much time. Then summer break started, vacations, etc.

Next idk, maybe Dogpatch and Mission Bay?

Surrounding Twin peaks, most streets have a meandering purple GPS path I’ve logged on it, generally completing (in order I walked it) Eureka Valley, Clarendon Heights, Upper Market, and Midtown Terrace.](/images/112985445693491391.png)
