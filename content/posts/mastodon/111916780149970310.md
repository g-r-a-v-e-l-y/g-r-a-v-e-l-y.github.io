fifth book of 2024: “A Wizard of Earthsea”, by Ursula K. Le Guin ( [https://www.ursulakleguin.com/a-wizard-of-earthsea](https://www.ursulakleguin.com/a-wizard-of-earthsea)).

After enjoying every single story in the “Hainish Novels and Stories ( [https://www.ursulakleguin.com/hainish-novels-and-stories](https://www.ursulakleguin.com/hainish-novels-and-stories)), I figured I can't go wrong tackling Earthsea for the first time by just reading all of them in the similar “The Books of Earthsea" ( [https://www.ursulakleguin.com/the-books-of-earthsea](https://www.ursulakleguin.com/the-books-of-earthsea)).
