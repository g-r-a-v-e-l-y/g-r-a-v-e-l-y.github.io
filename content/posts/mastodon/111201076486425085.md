22nd book of the year: “The Trial" by Franz Kafka.

Someone in Bernal Heights (Bonview at or near Cortland? It was a few months ago) left a box of books on the sidewalk with "FREE" written on a flap that had a few things I grabbed, among them, DFW's “Consider the Lobster, and other essays” which I started and abandoned (lol), and this.

I enjoy stuff like this from time to time but don't think I'm "smart enough" for it, whatever that means (and I'm not entirely sure).
