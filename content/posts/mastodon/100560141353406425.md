A YIMBY member arguing against Prop 10, which simply unblocks rent control in the state, but doesn't establish any, said “We give a voice to people who are not even here yet.” Repealing Costa Hawkins in favor of rent control, he argued, would help people already here at the expense of those to come.

He continued "...one time someone who was already here gave me hell me for calling it 'Frisco, so, like, fuck all of 'em, right?"
