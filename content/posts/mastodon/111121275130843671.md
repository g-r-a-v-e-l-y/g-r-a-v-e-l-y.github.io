my kid (5y old this week!) has been obsessed with building stuff out of cardboard after drawing front back top and sides and cutting them out and wanted me to make a transformer yesterday

so i searched for patterns and fell down a papercraft hole, do not recommend

fiddly as shit i had to do all of the assembly myself

he loves them though!

also, cyberdrone's deviantart is wild: [https://www.deviantart.com/cyberdrone](https://www.deviantart.com/cyberdrone)
