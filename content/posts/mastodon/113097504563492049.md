I need to find a band to play with, picking up a guitar at home just gets junior’s attention and then breaks the impulse to pick up the instrument in the first place, like a dog or cat vectoring in on the one person who isn't into one or the other (which is also me usually), or like a helicopter manager ignoring the headphones and full screen doc or IDE for a "hey, do you got a second?"

well, I didn’t, but I guess I have all day now, because, welp!
