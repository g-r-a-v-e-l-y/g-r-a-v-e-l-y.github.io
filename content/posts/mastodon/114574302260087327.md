the high school fan in me was pretty disappointed w/ the “becoming led zeppelin" thing that just came out. I bailed.

the second half is full of neat ‘68, '69, and ‘70 film of the band live, but not with the definitely available and in some cases highly regarded audio of those shows. Instead, studio or bbc session releases for completely different songs, and not even particularly good songs were used.

"Living Loving Maid”, to pick one they used, sucks, and was never in their actual live sets.
