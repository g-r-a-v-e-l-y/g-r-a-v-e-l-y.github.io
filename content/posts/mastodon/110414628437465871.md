As a fun thought experiment, every time I hear a car alarm going off in the city, I think to myself: Wow, our great Mayor, London Breed, who is a car, must really love San Francisco. There she is, living her best life, occupying a parking spot, honking her horn with devotion.

Honk! Honk! Honk!

So inspiring! 🤗🌁
