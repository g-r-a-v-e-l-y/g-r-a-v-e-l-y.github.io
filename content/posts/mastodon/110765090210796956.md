reading up on Boris Vian ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Vian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Vian)) after enjoying his very surreal story, "The Dead Fish." What a way to go out mad!


![wikipedia screenshot: DeathOn the morning of 23 June 1959, Vian was at the Cin√©ma Marbeuf for the screening of the film version of I will Spit on Your Graves. He had already fought with the producers over their interpretation of his work, and he publicly denounced the film, stating that he wished to have his name removed from the credits. A few minutes after the film began, he reportedly blurted out: "These guys are supposed to be American? My ass!" He then collapsed into his seat and died from sudden cardiac death on his way to the hospital.](/images/110765089929446270.jpeg)
