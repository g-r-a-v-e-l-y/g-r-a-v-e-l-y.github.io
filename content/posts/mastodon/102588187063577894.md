hadn’t gotten out of SF to the east coast burbs in a few years and forgot the entire colonial style house decorative shutters gimmick, now i’m picturing it continuing throughout the house on every conceivable windowish thing; tv shutters, picture frame shutters, doorway shutters, bathtub shutters, toilet shutters, etc
