nice, sometimes, when the fog is just right, as the sun sets, you get a rainbow through it


![cropped photo of a rainbow over the mission in san francisco from the center bottom of the frame to the top 1/6th from the right-edge, a power line crossed 1/6th across the bottom edge and the top two stories of building in the bottom left face west and reflect the sunset in its windows. the sky is mostly cloudy with some blue](/images/112895934424219836.jpeg)

![cropped photo of a rainbow touching down on the golden (dead) grass of bernal heights, the saturation is maxed out as is the luminance or something like that. A utility pole, trees, and buildings on 26th street fill the bottom 1/6th of the grame](/images/112895934734942782.jpeg)
