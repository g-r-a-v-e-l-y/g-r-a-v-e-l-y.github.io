fourteen: Greg Egan again, “Luminous”. It is out of print, but available self published by the author. The stories from just after those in Axiomatic (previously: [https://mastodon.social/@gravely/109661276920611083](https://mastodon.social/@gravely/109661276920611083)),

Some fun stuff, although I would have liked it a lot more had I read it contemporaneously, when I was in my own more annoying atheist phase.
