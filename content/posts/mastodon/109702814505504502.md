fourth book, "Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage", Haruki Murakami

I've had this on the shelf for a while (years, even) after catching up on Murakami and taking a good long break (furthermore, I think this was a gift, or used rack sale find, even) because it's all very samesy. I picked this off the to-read pile because it looked the shortest.

I think crit of his lesser stuff like this is totally on the mark and fair but also "it me" so, I enjoyed it.
