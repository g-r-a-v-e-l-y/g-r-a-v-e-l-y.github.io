19th book of the year, “4, 3, 2, 1", by Paul Auster ( [https://www.sfgate.com/books/article/4321-by-Paul-Auster-10889359.php](https://www.sfgate.com/books/article/4321-by-Paul-Auster-10889359.php))

Loved it, spent most of my spare time since I started it with it, will miss it, probably missed a lot in it.


![The paperback cover as I read it - lower-case individually-placed stencil letters on an uneven baseline, the author’s name in blue sky atop the title in rust or flame orange, all over flat navy blue](/images/111047266497532782.jpeg)
