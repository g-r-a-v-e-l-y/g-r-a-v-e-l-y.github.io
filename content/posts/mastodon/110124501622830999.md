going back for more Black Water, "Enoch Soames: A Memory of the Eighteen-Nineties" ( [https://www.fulltextarchive.com/book/Enoch-Soames/](https://www.fulltextarchive.com/book/Enoch-Soames/)) is fun both as a story and as motivation for silly nonsense (cw: spoiler,: [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1997/11/a-memory-of-the-nineteen-nineties/376995/](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1997/11/a-memory-of-the-nineteen-nineties/376995/))
