I read this one back in 2013 and I'm sure there are more modern treatments (which I'd be happy to hear about) but if you want get a 1987 perspective on the failed promises of computer skill acquisition you would probably do worse than to read Dreyfus & Dreyfus's "Mind Over Machine: The Power of Human Intuition and Expertise in the Era of the Computer” ( [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1039572.Mind_Over_Machine](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1039572.Mind_Over_Machine)).
