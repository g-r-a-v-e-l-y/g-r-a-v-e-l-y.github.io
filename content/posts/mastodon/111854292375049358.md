Second book of 2024: Glyn Johns, "Sound Man” ( [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20949444-sound-man](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20949444-sound-man))

Two memoirs to start the year. Weird, I never read memoirs.

This one was quoted in some video I watched chasing Chris Scruggs stuff ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeR2yZ2pWCw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeR2yZ2pWCw) what a great band! that steel player?!) that I probably landed on looking up a [https://500songs.com](https://500songs.com) (which I'm 90 episodes into) citation, so I found myself reading it.


![The paperback cover of Glyn Johns “Sound Man” as I read it, subtitled: A Life Recording Hits With The Rolling Stones, The Who, Led Zeppelin, The Eagles, Eric Clapton, The Faces…” (whispering: of that entire list of bands, I only really enjoy Led Zeppelin’s entire catalog, and barely a few individual songs from the rest. I don’t get the stones or the who, and I agree with The Dude re: the Eagles?)Anyway, it's fast, and fun if you ever went through a late 60s / early 70s rock phase before the 00s when it absolutely saturated american culture (let's not kid, it still does).](/images/111854292111059919.jpeg)
