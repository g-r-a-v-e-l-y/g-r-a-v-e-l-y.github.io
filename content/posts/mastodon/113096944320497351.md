was still thinkinâ€™ about that marg from a few weeks ago, and a then a friend in Marin gave us a few tomatoes from her garden.

this one is topped with additional chiffonaded basil, and smoked sea salt

I had pan fried some hot italian sausage (intending to pair with red onion slices and provolone instead of mozz) while the first two baked, for a third pizza, but this one was so good I didn't even bother with it, and so I tossed the extra dough ball in the freezer
