sf being a small town, it went like this

“and for this one I got a few days ago, it's Sun Ra so you know I gotta get something that sparkles”

"what night did you go?” another customer asks

“saturday”

"I went friday”, he says

“right on”

“sparkles, what are they like ABBA?" the frame shop worker asks

“no, kinda the opposite of ABBA" says the other guy

“more like jazz I guess" I say

“afro-futurism" he says

“uh, OK" the frame shop guy says
