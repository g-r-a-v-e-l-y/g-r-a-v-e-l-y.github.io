unexpected tiling window manager bonus: image popovers immediately get tiled to the same size

I never really got into these things because I guess it never occurred to me that they would have pleasant margin options for single app configs, which for some reason I kinda prefer (tiled round rect windows and drop shadows at 0px margin and padding look weird, to me)

I've used Moom ( [https://manytricks.com/moom/](https://manytricks.com/moom/)) for years, it’s great.

now I’m playing with Amethyst ( [https://manytricks.com/moom/](https://manytricks.com/moom/)) instead.

![the same image loaded on the same computer with nothing changed except that Amethyst is running and instantly yoinked the image to fill the entire screen, which is always what I wanted when I tell the computer to “show image” or whatever, instead of lightbox.js style nonsense](/images/112230337935762318.png)
