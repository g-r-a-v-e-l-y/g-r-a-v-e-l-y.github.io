sixth book: volume two of Ursula K. Le Guin's two volume collection, The Hainish Novels and Stories. ( [https://www.ursulakleguin.com/hainish-novels-and-stories](https://www.ursulakleguin.com/hainish-novels-and-stories) )

I've been working my way through the stories in the second volume for years, picking it off my to-read pile now and again. This weekend I read the Five Ways to Forgiveness cycle and am about half way through The Telling, which has me enthralled, so I'm calling this one done early.

Strongest possible endorsement for the entire collection.

![a 3D rendering of the box that The Hainish Novels and Stories of Ursula K. Le Guin comes in. It has a wrap around color photo of a long-exposure shot of the night sky turning over mountains as the sun rises (or sets?) behind them. Kind of a boring cover tbh.](/images/109903300834688934.png)
