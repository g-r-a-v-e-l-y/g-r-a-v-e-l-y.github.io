17th book of 2024: "The Book of Love”, by Kelly Link ( [https://kellylink.net/books/the-book-of-love](https://kellylink.net/books/the-book-of-love), [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/157981682-the-book-of-love](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/157981682-the-book-of-love)).

I kind agree w/ the haters on this one but maybe not very strongly?


![the hardback cover of “The Book of Love” by Kelly Link, as I read it. Title in mixed case  mixed case THE BooK oF LoVE” and author’s name upper case, both in black over a solid red background. Four rows of five moons line the cover in gold: crescent, waxing, full, waning, crescent. Alternating left and then right waning first, then waxing moons have silhouettes of faces instead of earth-shadows.](/images/112735849665471997.jpeg)
