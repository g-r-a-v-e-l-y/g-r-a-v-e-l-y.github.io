23rd book of the year: â€œZoey Is Too Drunk for This Dystopia" by Jason Pargin. Fun as expected. A pre-order, because that this point I just subscribe to Pargin stuff.

It's been two months since I finished anything, my head has not been in the right space to read, I'd bounced off three other things, and I've been taking lots of long walks instead.
