the bike infra surrounding UCSF (edit: mission bay) is extremely midâ€”flex post half-bike lanes (the right half of bike lanes between car lanes and parking lanes are actually door lanes) and sharrows, all of which pick up from and dump you nowhere

but the stoplights? really pretty bad. long timing, poor sensors, beg buttons etc. might as well be in Redwood City because they ignore me and I ignore them
