(my friday pizza bake is threaded so that you can mute it)

inspired by the "Bitter & Smokey” I had for lunch at Tony’s Napoletana yesterday, but too lazy to go buy ricotta or pancetta or broccoli rabe, I did the thing every online recipe commenter does and subbed the heck out of it with what I had on hand, but this time it turned out delicious, even with the left over frozen dough from a month ago that I used

I pre-cooked the broccoli in a carbon steel pan in the pizza oven, as one does

The flames of the oven are visible at the top of the photo as high as they get, and the oven is about 1000 degrees, the stone in the 800-900s, Fahrenheit. ](/images/112895837653286047.jpeg)
