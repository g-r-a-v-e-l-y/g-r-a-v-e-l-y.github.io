lmao a driver going south on Valencia turning right on Duboce with the windows all the way down inching into the bike lane was loudly scolded into the open passenger window by two guys ahead of me YOU ARE TURNING RIGHT ON A NO TURN RED while they pointed at the signs as I approached behind them hitting both of my breaks turned turned right on the red

purpose of a system is what does yes I know it's 420 but c'mon they had an SF parking sticker on the bumper, they're a local


![google maps street view of the no turn on red signs, red (cyclists had the green in this case)](/images/110233918174082437.png)
