walked past the place I lived 20+ years ago at Kalorama and Champlain: it's still there, hell yeah. saw three different people slip on the same ice patch on 18th near Florida. that sucks.

saw clusters of tents on the grass along the southern eastern side of the end of rock creek parkway near the bridge as you pass that gas station past the watergate which are both still there, on the taxi ride in. it is 20F and last weeks snow is still on the ground.
