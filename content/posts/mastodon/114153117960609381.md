totally thought I'd licked the entire time change thing until the everloving wife pointed out that I had made dinner an hour late every day this week. I went back to cross reference the last post I made in chat at work and even that was an hour later than I normally work.

what the hell? I've been getting up around 5AM like I normally do and then just disappearing an hour somewhere to fall back?
