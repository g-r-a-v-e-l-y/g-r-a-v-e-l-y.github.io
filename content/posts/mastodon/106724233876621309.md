cowardly starting with the small stuff

I really enjoyed my first exposure to Prometheus Bound ( [https://www.nyrb.com/products/prometheus_bound?variant=1094930949](https://www.nyrb.com/products/prometheus_bound?variant=1094930949)) and Raymond Queneau’s “We Always Treat Women Too Well” ( [https://www.nyrb.com/products/we-always-treat-women-too-well?variant=1094933097](https://www.nyrb.com/products/we-always-treat-women-too-well?variant=1094933097)) this weekend!
