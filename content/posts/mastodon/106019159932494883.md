Monday: Sarah Pinsker , _Sooner or Later Everything Falls Into the Sea_, ( [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40032435-sooner-or-later-everything-falls-into-the-sea](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40032435-sooner-or-later-everything-falls-into-the-sea)). Two pages into the first story I remembered Iâ€™d read it before ( [https://escapepod.org/2015/06/27/ep497-a-stretch-of-highway-two-lanes-wide/](https://escapepod.org/2015/06/27/ep497-a-stretch-of-highway-two-lanes-wide/)) and got stoked because it and every other story here (which I had not read) is excellent.
