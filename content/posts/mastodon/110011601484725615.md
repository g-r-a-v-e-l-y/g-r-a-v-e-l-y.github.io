Aside: I mostly chose what to read when someone else who I specifically think is cool (even if I don't know them or w/e) says or posts that they like something and it has almost never let me down.

![Tweet screenshot@ImJuneFacts: The best novel I read this year was The Museum of Eterna's Novel (the First Good Novel). It has 50 prologues for the simple reason that the book is reluctant to begin, and is metafiction in the sense that it explores an intermediate reality between our own and that of the fiction](/images/110011601084042953.png)
