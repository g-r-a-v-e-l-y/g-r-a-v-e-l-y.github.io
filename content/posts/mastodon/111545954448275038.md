I get that it’s synecdoche or w/e but the "this bike lane is killing small blah blah" slogan is kinda funny

the entire road was redesigned—parking removed, turns prohibited, etc. so it is annoying to center (heh) the bike lane in the argument when so few bike riders even wanted the stupid thing

if the posters said “SFMTA is killing…” we'd all agree with it
