this is a qt of [https://social.lol/@spotlightonpod/111952783201740255](https://social.lol/@spotlightonpod/111952783201740255)

so after reading this I thought of a monthly "new artists" CD mailer subscription I had in the late 90s that I coulda swore had a Marley track one month, which is weird, right?

so I checked my Plex for Marley, picked Catch a Fire, saw “Midnight Ravers”, which was the chorus I was thinking of, but not it.

ddg for a remix and found it: Bill Laswell’s “Dreams Of Freedom (Ambient Translations Of Bob Marley In Dub)”: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8sDYYwu2t8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8sDYYwu2t8)

neato.
