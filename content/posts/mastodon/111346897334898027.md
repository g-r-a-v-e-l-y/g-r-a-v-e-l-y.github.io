have been going for walks every weekday morning for the past two weeks after dropping the kid off at school and following “whatever is steeper" holistic routes

Yesterday, we dropped junior off at Flynn and then climbed the steps south from Cesar Chavez near the highway and went around the east of Bernal.

It’s fun to see out parts of the city I've seen from afar for years, and this area specifically would make for a great new walk or two in Bakalinski's Stairway Walks of SF
