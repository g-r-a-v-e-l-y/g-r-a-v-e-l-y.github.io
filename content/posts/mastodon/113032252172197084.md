21: “Family Furnishings", by Alice Munro

The later, somewhat darker, more explicitly autobiographical half of Munro’s anthologies of short stories.

Munro's characters tend to (I know this reads like a horoscope) move on from situations for the next thing without a plan, or to be a little selfish before getting back to being serious, if they ever do. She's always putting characters on trains, or in cars, or on buses.
