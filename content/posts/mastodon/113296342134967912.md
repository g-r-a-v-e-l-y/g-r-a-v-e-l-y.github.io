lol at the worldbuilding you get mid-book explaining why multiples are absolutely taboo:

a planet colonized libertarians who named their planet Gault gets invaded by a another libertarian who keeps cloning himself and militarizing until he's taken over, and nukes the first ship to come see what's going on

The nearest other planet realizes they have to nip this in the bud and sends a ship into Gault at .9 c.
