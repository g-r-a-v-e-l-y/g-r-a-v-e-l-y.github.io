good morning


![photograph from the corner of 25th Street at San Bruno Street looking northwest at San Bruno, a rainbow rises from the far right in an arc that, if complete, would end on Sutro Tower on the far left, but is only brightly visible for a few degrees of arcI’ve been jacking the saturation on my city shots lately to max it out because it feels more accurate at a glance to what it’s like to look at this stuff irl and also to pop the rainbow. I’m sure this is just a phase I’ll regret like when I used to add vigent to every photo I retouched. Whatever!](/images/111880393291691275.jpeg)
