having been futzing with it for a few weeks now, 11ty pathing and globbing as seemingly intended in the current reference setup [https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) is still pretty befuddling, specifically how â€œImages can be co-located with blog post files" is done.

the example "home" index doesn't include any post contents, just titles and dates. if you want to include content, that's easy, but it won't be able to find the images

weird. anyway, [https://gravely.pizza](https://gravely.pizza) lives again
