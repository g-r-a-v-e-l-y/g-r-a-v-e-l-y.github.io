aside, while i'm mad-posting about cars

in the fall when I started these walks I was able to make up for morning routine interruptions by ending my day with a walk instead.

I had to knock that shit off after daylight savings because it is even unsafer than normal to be a pedestrian crossing streets as soon as the sun begins to set, and that just gets worse and worse hour over hour until the sun comes back up
