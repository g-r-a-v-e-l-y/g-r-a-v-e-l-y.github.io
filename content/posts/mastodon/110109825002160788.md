i'm sitting here watching this old jacques pepin video, he's making a risotto milanese (with american brown rice), and he gets to the saffron and just whips out a tin that has an ounce of god damned saffron in it, lmao ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5vUuLh3ASQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5vUuLh3ASQ))


![screenshot of video, ECU an open tin of an ounce of god damned safron, which is the size of two decks of cards stacked, close captioned “I have one ounce of saffron here.”](/images/110109702165768992.png)
