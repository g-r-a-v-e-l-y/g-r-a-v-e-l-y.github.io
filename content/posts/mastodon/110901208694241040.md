also, re-reading Bartleby (the original anti-makin' copies guy) reminded me that 1) he has office mates named Turkey, Nippers, and Ginger Nut (tag yourself) and 2) "I would prefer not to" is only his first catch phrase, once he wore that out he pivoted to "I am not particular.” which is also delicious.
