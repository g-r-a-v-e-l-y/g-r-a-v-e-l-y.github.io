Just read the first chapter of Ursula Franklin's Massey Lectures ( [https://monoskop.org/images/5/58/Franklin_Ursula_The_Real_World_of_Technology_1990.pdf](https://monoskop.org/images/5/58/Franklin_Ursula_The_Real_World_of_Technology_1990.pdf)) because it was recommended by [@Mer__edith](https://mastodon.world/@Mer__edith) in this old Politico interview ( [https://www.politico.com/newsletters/digital-future-daily/2023/12/01/5-questions-for-meredith-whittaker-00129677](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/digital-future-daily/2023/12/01/5-questions-for-meredith-whittaker-00129677)) and it's excellent.

Ordered a paperback ( [https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-real-world-of-technology-ursula-franklin/9995479?ean=9780887846366&next=t&next=t](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-real-world-of-technology-ursula-franklin/9995479?ean=9780887846366&next=t&next=t) ) to finish the rest.
