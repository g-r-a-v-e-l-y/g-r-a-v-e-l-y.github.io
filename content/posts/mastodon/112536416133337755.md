16th book of 2024: "You Like it Darker", by Stephen King ( [https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/201242757-you-like-it-darker](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/201242757-you-like-it-darker))

There are a few authors I simply pre-order without question—Jason Pargin, Kelly Link, Emily Wilson in the past year alone, but always King. I was going to save this for vacation in a few weeks but ended up with more time on my hands so it came off the pile.

I particularly liked "The Answer Man”


![The hardback cover of “You Like it Darker” by Stephen King, as I read it. Author name over title in a pale yellow all-caps futura variant with a few pointed descenders and an interesting capital K specifically (more like a leaning V with a tail stollen from the letter Q?) over a photograph of an island with two palm trees in dark browns and blues.](/images/112536415846206112.jpeg)
