I called 911 on an active fire on Osage St. (the half block west of / behind Mission St) this evening near 26th because I saw a garage door smoking in a funny way. (nobody was hurt afaik)

SFFD made from a few blocks away in about 90 seconds? It was pretty remarkable. They had to chainsaw the door off and use hoses on it.

Anyway, I've never done that before, nice to have on hand!
