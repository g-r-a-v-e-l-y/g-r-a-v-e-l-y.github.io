most of the content is even more personally embarrassing than it was when I blew it away last time, six years ago. No one should have to reconcile with specific texts of their own teens, twenties, or thirties, which was the explicit reason I used to keep it up, until I didn't believe it anymore: the unexamined life, blah, blah, blah
