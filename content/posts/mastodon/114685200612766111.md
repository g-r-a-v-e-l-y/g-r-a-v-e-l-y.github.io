it was kinda nice to get to civic center and not really find any electeds going on about some nonsense on a PA system, it was just like, well we're here, that was nice, there's the avakian revcom weirdos [wayne's world wayne seeing-stacy-face] there's the people from salt tabling, ok, well let's walk back up market and see how long it is, wow this is a lot, very cool

ah well I guess that's it, ok, cya, Iâ€™m gonna go get a beer, ok cya I've got plans, yeah cool, later
