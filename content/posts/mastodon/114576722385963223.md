![photo of the back of someone’s house, which faces the new Sunset Dunes Park in san francisco. Thy’ve got a wooden fence about 8 foot tall, the house is yellow with aluminum windows and a black pitched roof. Peeking over the roofline of the fence is one of those giant skeletons people get for halloween. Only the skull is visible but it is probably the entire thing behind the fence, and it is facing kinda northwest toward Sunset Dunes. Even cooler, someone put a fake pigeon (?!) on top of the skull, which, like, nice job.](/images/114576722098636240.jpeg)
