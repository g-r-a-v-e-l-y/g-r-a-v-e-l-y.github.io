I've got a date-night sitter booked tonight but my date is out of town so I looked at event calendars for the usual haunts and, hey neat, Robert Cherny presents "San Francisco Reds: Communists in the Bay Area, 1919 to 1958.”, 7-8:30, at Bird & Beckett ( [https://birdbeckett.com](https://birdbeckett.com), [https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?mode=week&src=r5o3loovr013c5rftpv75lji18@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?mode=week&src=r5o3loovr013c5rftpv75lji18@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles)).

Baring any complications (my kid has a cold that could but probably won’t escalate), I'm there.
