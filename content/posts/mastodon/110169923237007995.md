ninth book, a real (borrowing from the afterword) wrist-punishing, discursive, door-stopper: “Novel Explosives" by Jim Gauer ( [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29363276-novel-explosives](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29363276-novel-explosives))

I looked for a review that resonated: [https://books.substack.com/p/review-joy-williams-on-jim-gauer](https://books.substack.com/p/review-joy-williams-on-jim-gauer)
