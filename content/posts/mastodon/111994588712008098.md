another nice day to try SFMTA recommended bike routes ( [https://www.sfmta.com/sites/default/files/pdf_map/2021/06/sfmta_recommendedbikeroutes_0.pdf](https://www.sfmta.com/sites/default/files/pdf_map/2021/06/sfmta_recommendedbikeroutes_0.pdf)), so this time I went southeast: Chavez to Illinois to Cargo, side-quest out Heron's Head Park and Hunter's Point, back on the route to Mendel, Palou, Keith, Carrol, out to Candlestick Point, reverse back to Jenning, Paul, Bayshore, and Chavez home.

Lovely!
