18th book of 2024: “Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore”, by Robin Sloan ( [https://www.robinsloan.com/books/penumbra/](https://www.robinsloan.com/books/penumbra/)).

Fun, light, very quick read. Very weird to read something so connected to ~2012-techie-San-Francisco (I was here by then) and get 100% of the references (and roll my eyes at a few w/ 12 years of hindsight).


![The paperback cover “Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore”, by Robin Sloan, as I read it. Nine rows of yellow blocks stamped alternating between four or five stacked on their back and four or five upright like books on a shelf but leaning left or right at random. The title and “A Novel” and author name are in hand written script over the entire front. ](/images/112765662442711723.jpeg)
