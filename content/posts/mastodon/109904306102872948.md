realized my "itâ€™s still there" gag about Bernal Heights generally could have been read as if I had anything to do w/ the (cool) antifa cycling club sticker in one of my photos. Nope, I've got nothing to do with that.

I was just joking about Bernal Heights generally still being there. Anywhay, here's another picture. OK, cya.
