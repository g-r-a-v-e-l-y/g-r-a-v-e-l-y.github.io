incredibly neat to me, after having read it, to learn that Kohlhaas was a historical person ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Kohlhaas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Kohlhaas)), that Marthin Luther actually did attempt to intercede, and even cooler, that Kohlhaas was out doing direction actions for 8 years to get justice before the state got him (and broke him on the wheel, yikes)

also there's of course a feature film which I'm probably not gonna bother with but what if it's good idk [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2054790/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2054790/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)
