apparently there are real hardy types who consider it just a hotel who would rather be in a tent or something but i would love to be snowed in at the ahwanee rn while the entire valley is snowed in, by that fireplace


!["the great lounge" room at the big, old, fancy, 20s lodge in the yosemite valley; a huge room of 20' ceilings, three great long walls of glazing looking out on a meadow, seating for hundreds, and a great big fireplace on one wall with sofas facing it, which i've personally enjoyed a great book on, in front of said fire, on a quiet evening](/images/109929013791735786.jpeg)
