I never have any urge to post what I think about people like stephen miller on here because it would feel like bad smalltalk, just casual observations of a shared banality.

for some insane reason I instead am constantly not posting the same nonsense on linkedin, a website I don't understand and dislike the need for, because "they" (??) need to hear it.
