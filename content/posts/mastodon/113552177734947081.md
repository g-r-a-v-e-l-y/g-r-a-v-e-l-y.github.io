Getting another [@paulrickards](https://mastodon.social/@paulrickards) piece framed at the same time as the [@SunRaUniverse](https://universeodon.com/@SunRaUniverse) poster I got Saturday at the show.

I wanted to get the plotter piece with ornate yellow cope in the top right corner but it would have been 10x the cost so I lowered my sights a little to the one on the piece. 🖊️☀️

And the Sun Ra Arkestra poster absolutely had to be sparkles, but again the ones pictured around it are eye-poppingly expensive so I went with a smaller, finer grit, but still sparkle, not pictured. 🪩🤗
