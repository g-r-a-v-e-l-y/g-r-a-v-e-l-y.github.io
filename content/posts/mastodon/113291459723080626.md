my recall for the scales is fine even in every other common CAGED position

the tempo is fine

playing with a metronome clackin' on the 2s and 4s is brutal! I feel like someone trying to jump rope just slamming themself in the leg.

metronome: clack clack clack clack clack...

me, trying as hard as I can: clack THREE clack ONE clack THREE clack TWO clack FOUR clack FUCK

metronome: clack clack clack clack clackâ€¦

if I manage to come in on a correct one I'm fine and it feels fine
