a few of my favorite very-online writers—but I'm think of Pargin and Jeb Lund (who for all I know don't know each other at all) specifically here and not like, uh, Lockwood—are pretty good about using their veterans-of-forum-wars (or at least that era of online) past to be pretty strong voices for not being assholes on the internet.

this is a lot of that
