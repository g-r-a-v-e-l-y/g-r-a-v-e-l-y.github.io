kinda annoying (to me, of me, and of-me-to-me) to read a great story and think "ah dang this was originally published in so-and-such maybe I should just subscribe to that to see those stories as they come out" but it always ends up being the atlantic or the new yorker or some other nonsense I canâ€™t tolerate reading.

thanks for funding the arts, jerks!
