19th book of 2024: “Sourdough”, by Robin Sloan ( [https://www.robinsloan.com/books/sourdough/](https://www.robinsloan.com/books/sourdough/)).

Re-using my comment on Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore: “Fun, light, very quick read. Very weird to read something so connected to ~2017~ techie-San-Francisco and get 100% of the references and roll my eyes at a few of them.”

Started Sloan's newest, Moonbound, immediately afterward, and it’s very different so far.
