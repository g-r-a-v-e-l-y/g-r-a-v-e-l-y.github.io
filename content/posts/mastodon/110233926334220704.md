the last time I yelled at someone doing the same thing at the same intersection, the guys working the oil change spot got on their drive through intercom PA and said [PHSK!] “STOP YELLING”

(also not trying to be a bike account but this shit happens multiple times a day but we _just_ talked about this spot lolsob)
