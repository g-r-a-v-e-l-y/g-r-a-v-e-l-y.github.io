idk how the website works but in tweetbot, when I block/mute someone, I still see quote posts, it just doesnâ€™t render the inner, even if I also keyword mute their handle

so I just tried to keyword mute [https://twitter.com/their_handle](https://twitter.com/their_handle), and now even the quote tweets are gone! hell yeah
