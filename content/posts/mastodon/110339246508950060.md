hey this guy that gets to tell us what to do because he has $500,000,000 and we don’t would like us to commute out to another company's office which used to be in the city but isn't anymore because ugh, city taxes

he's giving a fake interview because he thought of new things to tell us to do now that our shared presence isn't a potential death sentence. we're calling it a fireside chat!

all the gang is gonna be there, even a magazine called “Fortune" which is definitely for "us" ;) ;)
