15th book of 2024: "White Cat Black Dog”, by Kelly Link.

I particularly enjoyed the last one, “Skinder's Veil”

I've never actually read any actual Brothers Grimm, nor have I read (or even heard of) Lang's “The Blue Fairy Book” which I just learned about in a review of these Link stories, so I think they have to both go on the pile.
