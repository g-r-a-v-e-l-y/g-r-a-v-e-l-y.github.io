tenth book of 2024: “Pnin", by Vladimir Nabokov. Nice.


![the current Vintage International paperback cover of “Pnin” by Vladimir Nabovkov, as I read it:a black leather frame that is set on and shadows a white field contains a bow tie constructed of two or three pieces of maroon paper covered with the lowercase typewritten letters p, n, i, and n in repetitive 8 letter blocks is affixed to white board with sewing pins.and a strip of cream paper with “Pnin” typewritten below,](/images/112231536027923764.png)
