Munro has been a welcome break from the masculine, genre-dominated shit I've been reading. Shelving this one my shelf next to a pile of Murakami with only "Everyone In Silico‚Äù by Jim Munroe ( [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/342203.Everyone_in_Silico](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/342203.Everyone_in_Silico)) between, as a mediator of sorts, makes for a heck of a counterpoint.

Unlike (or, like?) Murakami, Munro's women age (natch) and have their own experiences, inner lives, and desires. Munro's also a slightly more interesting prosist (to me).
