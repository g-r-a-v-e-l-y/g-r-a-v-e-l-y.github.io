maybe a silly thing to get excited about but every single time I'm all: “Wow! Look at it go!”

Tomorrows 20" NY style pizza dough, which I made a few days ago using 10% wheat, 90% bread flour, and cold water, mixed in a food processor until the center of the dough read in the high 70s F (about 75 seconds), and then immediately cold fermented for a few days.
