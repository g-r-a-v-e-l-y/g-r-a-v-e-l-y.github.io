I read volume one+ when I bought this five years ago*: Rocannonâ€™s World, Planet of Exile, City of Illusions, The Left Hand of Darkness and The Dispossessed, as well as The Word for World Is Forest. Thanks for the suggestion all those years ago [@InclinedPlane](https://mastodon.social/@InclinedPlane)!

* I probably would have finished this a lot sooner but four and a half years ago we had a kid, ðŸ« .
