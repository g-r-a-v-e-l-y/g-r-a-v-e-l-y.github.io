I went with Lagrima ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOiqArLby5o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOiqArLby5o)) and Freight Train ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPWEuoaQYQo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPWEuoaQYQo)) but in hindsight, that someone _requested_ acoustic-guitar-dude is surreal and I still donâ€™t believe it happened, like, maybe it was a nightmare. his, or mine, or the other persons, idk
