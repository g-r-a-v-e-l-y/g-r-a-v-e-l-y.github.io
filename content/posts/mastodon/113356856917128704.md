looking at linkedin from time to time is like wandering into the wrong church where I donâ€™t know any of the rituals (which for me would be any church, but I do know one set of rituals I don't practice, at least) and seeing random people I know there, doing some of the moves

damn you're here? where is here? oh, they left. huh.

hey, want to come to dinner? no? this is so weird
