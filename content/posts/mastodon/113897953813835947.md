making chilean sea bass and dry fried green beans and right off the bat the book I'm using ( [http://www.fuchsiadunlop.com/books/the-food-of-sichuan/](http://www.fuchsiadunlop.com/books/the-food-of-sichuan/)) for the beans cops that while you could dry fry them, most people deep fry them, and for another thing, you can also just bake them and then stir fry them, which is what I'm doing because I'm feeling p lazy this evening
