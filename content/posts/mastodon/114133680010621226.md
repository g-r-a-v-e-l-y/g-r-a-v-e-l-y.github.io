the sonophone ios app has a delightfully responsive volume slider but the navigation confuses me so I can't get into the habit of using it exclusively.

this home assistant hack can't do search, which is a bummer.

honestly plexamp continues to be the most delightful but theyâ€™ve chosen to deprioritize and kill http streams too, and its speaker targets are limited to airplay and bluetooth, and both stink.
