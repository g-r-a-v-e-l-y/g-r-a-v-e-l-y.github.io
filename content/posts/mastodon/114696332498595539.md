we lose sun on our western-oriented patio around 3 or 3:30 in the afternoon this time of year but the summer sun sets just north enough to tag from around the other side of the building and hit the farthest northwest patio corner from 5:30 to 6:30PM before we lose it again and that sun patch is like my secret book nook to escape out to for one month a year. I love it.
