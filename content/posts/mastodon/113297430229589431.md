🚶🏽‍♂️

🏁 what I'm considering Sunnyside (including City College like [https://sunnysideassociation.org/the-neighborhood/](https://sunnysideassociation.org/the-neighborhood/) does seems greedy)

City College has so many damned pathways that it's going to take a bunch of tedious human pen-plotter meanders that I'm going to consider it its own thing, like I did w/ Laguna Honda which I already walked but Strava paused as I put my phone back in my pocket from the top of the trailhead so I gotta go do again at some point.

Bonus, I can start from Balboa Park BART for a while now.


![A map of San Francisco, Balboa Park BART along the center-bottom, Glen Park BART in the top right corner, 280 bisecting along the two, and the entirety of Sunnyside’s streets (and most alleys) marked with a purple trail. I’ve also decided to walk the front paths of City College rather than loop down to Ocean Ave to square off the ‘hood because it was prettier.](/images/113297429978058859.png)
