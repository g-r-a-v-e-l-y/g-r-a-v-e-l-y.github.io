just got around to ordering prints to go in the the mat we had everyone sign at our wedding 18 years ago, from the dvd the photographer burned us, which I'd eventually lost, but only after uploading them to flickr which I eventually deleted but had exported first, 9 years ago, which I only just imported to apple photos from my file server.

âœ… can you order me a print of this picture? [a data warehouse of crossed out due dates]
