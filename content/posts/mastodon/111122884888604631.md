It's all in the second person, which i got used to but, ugh

it'll probably make an OK movie

it reminded me a lot of Jeff Noon who I enjoy more for this kind of thing

Being set in and about Sri Lanka and Sri Lanka politics was really neat

it's pretty brutal in some places, which I don't get down with

the twist was annoying

the last 20 pages were not needed
