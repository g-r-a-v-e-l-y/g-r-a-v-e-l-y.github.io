recology sanitation engineers have an off-the-books, for-charity, annual, competitions (regional and national), and one of the events is a timed wheel-can storage race (faster is better) judged by how interlocked the lids can be.

when any one lid can't be opened on account of the engineer's clever interleaving of a neighboring can's lid's lip, they call it "captured lid locking" (the technical term) and, they are scored on how many lids they can lock.

as in all sport, doping is a problem.
