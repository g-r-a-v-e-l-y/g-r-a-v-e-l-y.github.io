anti-car urbanists (bless) should update their priors for:

1) car seat recs for children (until age 12 ( [https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/documents/carseat-recommendations-for-children-by-age-size.pdf](https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/documents/carseat-recommendations-for-children-by-age-size.pdf))

2) “come get / take your kid right somewhere away”

3) load out and grocery needs of parents

vs our (US) built environment

I’m on the team otherwise!
