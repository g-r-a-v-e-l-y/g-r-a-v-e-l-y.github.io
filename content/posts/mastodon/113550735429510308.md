every morning I crack three eggs into a non-stick pan on medium heat, slide them off to a plate sunny side up when they are ready, return the pan to the stove, raise the heat to medium-high, and fry spinach and a few cherry tomatoes in olive oil which spatters oil all over the place

today after having made a mess, oh idk, probably a thousand times or so over the past few years, I plopped the spinach on top of the tomatoes once it wilted a little and it prevented the spatter mess entirely. gdi.
