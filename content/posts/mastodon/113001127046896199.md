üò¨ a lil' nervous, I have an appointment with a stylist this afternoon, my first since February 2020, when I was forced to end years of an every-three-weeks wash and style scissor-cut booking near the office (a luxury). I, eventually started cutting my own.

I found ‚Äúvery short‚Äù to be pretty easy to DIY, but decided to let it go nearly two years ago and started growing it out long, w/ DIY maintenance.
