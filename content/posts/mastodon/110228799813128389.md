everloving wife couldn't find my wool cardigan to steal so she put on the very moth eaten cashmere pullover that she asks me to get rid of every single time i wear, going on ten years, since the moths were a real problem, and which she had never ever worn before, on account of all the moth holes in it, and said "damn sweater is comfy as hell."
