a move I've noticed cool hip with-it conflict-avoidant people do which I've decided to try to do is to make more claims about my own experience than I normally would because it feels redundant or just a lot of work to do all the time

so instead of “you should __" or "people should __" I try to go with with “I have __ and here's how it worked out for me, to me.”
