it is p funny to me that the dumbest people on earth who respect no one and no thing who bumble through life with least effort reactions damning all consequence are still participating in the meritocracy of J.D.s and Ivies and so on.

feels like every day we learn ‚Äùoh, so and so idiot is now the head of blah blah" and it's their lawyer or something.

why the pretense? just appoint whoever, who cares at this point?
