silly nonsense update, i've completed the seventy or eighty prologues to The Museum of Eterna's Novel (The First Good Novel) by Macedonio Fern√°ndez and would like to congratulate myself for not posting out of context paragraphs of it this entire time like this one, which it is full of. now to start the novel itself


![three paragraphs of mid prologue boasting, thanking readers of bad posts for staying committed to reading posts while waiting for the first good post to come along, of which this is but one of dozens of prologues, and thanking the bad posters for posting all the bad posts, which keep said readers reading, because this is why they will still be readers who read said first good post](/images/109991459602996248.jpeg)
