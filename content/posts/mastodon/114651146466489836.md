I picked up the inferno (this hollander one [https://archive.org/details/dante-dantes-the-divine-comedy-the-inferno-2012-dante-alighieri-robert-hollander-jean-hollander](https://archive.org/details/dante-dantes-the-divine-comedy-the-inferno-2012-dante-alighieri-robert-hollander-jean-hollander) ) off my now two-shelf long to-read, half-read, and probably dnfing pile because I'm about to get to it in the Berkeley philosophy lectures I I'm listening to on walks anymore (Dreyfus mentioned previously, [https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley_webcast_itunesu_461120619](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley_webcast_itunesu_461120619)) and it's in the form canto, commentary on canto, canto 2, commentary on canto 2, and so on
