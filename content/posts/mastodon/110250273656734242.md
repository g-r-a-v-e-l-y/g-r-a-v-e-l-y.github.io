nice, Black Water has "The Monkey's Paw" in it, ( [https://www.owleyes.org/text/monkeys-paw/read/](https://www.owleyes.org/text/monkeys-paw/read/)) shortly followed by another wishing tale: Robert Louis Stevenson's "The Bottle Imp".

where better to start a story about wish than a hilltop mansion so earned in san francisco [https://americanliterature.com/author/robert-louis-stevenson/short-story/the-bottle-imp](https://americanliterature.com/author/robert-louis-stevenson/short-story/the-bottle-imp)
