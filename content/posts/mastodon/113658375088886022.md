I don't go to security conferences much anymore but a friend not on here and I were both on sg-dc and lived in DC in 2004, so, when the CFP got posted there ( [https://marc.info/?l=sg-dc&m=109509914217942&w=2](https://marc.info/?l=sg-dc&m=109509914217942&w=2)). It got his attention.

I didn't end up getting a barcode until November 30th. I walked to and from the con at the Wardman each day from my place in Adam's Morgan.

One of the nights, we got dinner w/ [@webjedi](https://infosec.exchange/@webjedi) (his boss) and a few months later I quit my IT job started working for 'em as a security engineer.

So.
