Over the summer two friends and I brainstormed some ideas for a value-add URL
shortener. I know, I know.

It was going to do a bunch of security checks against URLs it was asked to
shorten, and when [Chris](http://ensey.org/) had the original idea, nobody
else was doing anything like it. [Aaron](http://outerbody.com) quickly scraped
together something that could shorten urls, and 301 them when they came in,
and call out to various security checks along the way. Meanwhile we wiki'd
together a huge list of features we wanted. Features current url shorteners
still lack.

We kinda lacked a revenue model though, or time to work on the project, or
funding.

Oh well.

I did make a logo for it, with Chris's help.

I think doing it again I'd leave off the entire 'us' bit in the logo, it
throws the balance too much.
