This is probably my favorite fax of all time:

Sent to [work](http://www.guruconsult.com/) by a client of mine after her Windows 95 (yeah 95, I said it) PC froze up after I'd recommended that they not use it at all / replace it.

(10.4.3 fixed my ability to pull images off my phone using bluetooth, lot of catchup posting to do)
