	<p>It took a survey of nearly everyone for annoyance levels and preferences before I updated what <a href="http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/19147">textpander</a> replaces &#8220;/sig&#8221; with to this, and I still think it&#8217;s too long / am considering consolidating a line or two. <br />

	<p>Too jumbled, I&#8217;m afraid. </p>

	<p>I&#8217;m <i>still</i> a huge supporter of bottom-replying but have adapted to being a top after surveying everyone I know for how <i>they</i> would like to read e-mail from me. People look at me like I&#8217;m a leper when I suggest that they set their default mail reader to show everyone&#8217;s e-mail in blue comic sans with a :cb: tiled background instead of configuring it to <i>compose</i> every e-mail with that stationary. Keep your cute styling to yourself tyvm, rant rant, and so on.  The next circle closer is encapsulation. A three line note plus picture do not need to be in a word document. </p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.jokerbone.com/2004/11/24/mail-disclaimer/">ranted about this sort of thing before</a> but my memory was just jogged by a <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2005/11/07/five-email-tics-id-love-for-you-to-lose/">43 Folders</a> post. </p>
