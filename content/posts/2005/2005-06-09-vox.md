**Vox AD15VT Valvetronix 15W Guitar Amp**

Kevin raved. I read reviews.

Last weekend playing guitar w/ my Stage 112SE 180Watt 12" amp turned up to 4/10 on the clean channel through my multi-effects pedal turned to 6 out of 100. Something jiggles the cable connecting the pedal to the amp.

Maybe it's the stone-cone I'm jamming in but anxiety that the neighbors are trying to hide from World War III over in 5F is enough for me to stop playing.

To the rescue:

  * 15W
  * 8" speaker
  * Real tube-power sound from Vox Valve Reactor circuit
  * Real 12AX7 triode tube and low-wattage tube power circuit
  * 11 amp models
  * 11 high-quality effects
  * User programs
  * Preset mode for quick model access
  * Knob-based interface for easy editing
  * Manual mode for real time adjustments

Now I just have to wait the 2-5 business days for it to ship to the office.
