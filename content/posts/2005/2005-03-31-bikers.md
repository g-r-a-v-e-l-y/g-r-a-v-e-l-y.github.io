> Hi- We have never been formally introduced, but we have exchanged words on the WOD trail in Falls Church several times in the last few months.
>
> You - stressed out, middle aged, Armstrong wanna be in ridiculous tight bike clothes, going about 50 MPH on the busy trail. Me- the woman walking on the trail with a stroller or a kid or two on scooters.
>
> Each time you blast by us, you have used profanity at me and my kids, screamed it's a "GOD D BIKE TRAIL, LADY!" , "GET THE F OFF THE BIKE TRAIL AHOLES!", "F'ING IDIOTS!", "GET THE F OUT OF THE WAY!".
>
> I got news for you buddy, the WOD is not a 'BIKE TRAIL'. It's a trail for everyone, walkers, riders, skaters, even horseback riders. Like the signs say "SHARE THE TRAIL".
>
> I imagine that you are an angry little man who probably has had his drivers license suspended for some incredibility stupid and dangerous driving. Now you are raging against women and children on the trail.
>
> I have started to carry a big fat walking stick, and next time you scream at me or my kids I am going to take your spokes out with itâ€¦.you can walk home if you're able.
>
> this is in or around Falls Church
