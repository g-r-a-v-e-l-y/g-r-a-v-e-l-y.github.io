I spied this in a parking garage in Silver Spring today, tucked under the driver's-side windshield wiper of a non-descript blue Ford Explorer.

Masterful use of the ellipsis and double-exclamantion-points. Handwriting analysis says female to me but I could be wrong. A pro could probably trace the shape of the T, D, and H strokes to a decade and a region of the country in which the person was instructed in the arts of writing - I'm going to pull for the 1960's if not earlier but can't place a region.

I saw nothing indicating that the owner of the truck was in fact, a hunter. The owner could be _named_ Hunter and this is a personal death threat. Ideally, the Hunter is actually named Dead Hunter – if true this note can be taken as a love note.

**UPDATE**:

As I was backing out, I snagged a shot of the front license plate. The picture sucks but it says HUNTER Ford, NC with mountains on either side, black on yellow - looks like a dealer plate.

Google shows that there are [a handful of dealerships in Henerson, NC](http://www.google.com/local?num=100&hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&safe=off&q=hunter&near=Hendersonville,+NC&sa=X&oi=localr) that the Hunter family owns.

What a moron.
