The wordpress [template](http://binarybonsai.com/kubrick/) I use has become the default wordpress theme. I'm seeing it everywhere, understandably as it is very nicely done.

Digging [this font](http://fontleech.com/04/01/2005/smeltery/), I finally started work on a new masthead / design.

The feel is very late-90's Zeldman to me, not that that's a bad thing.

I am also considering ditching the name in favor of [writequit](http://www.writequit.com/).
