Yet more proof that county employee's have too much time on their hands:

RAID0 has been given a full burial. :ghost:

Ben: He should have had more redundancy.
Anonymous: Doesnâ€™t he look like him self?

Coincidentally, my morning client had a SCSI card failure and is now without a server, which I guess is kinda similar right? One of our other clients (not mine) also had a RAID1 failure today, but I think the engineer has it back online now, because it's RAID1 and that can be done :)

**Update**! Now with Mourners.

Amazing.
