I'm 5/6 of the way through the audio-book of Mr. Feynman's second book, _What do you Care what other People Think_, which is very touching and I highly recommend you borrow from me. So I was reading up on him and stumbled upon a [speech](http://www.physics.brocku.ca/etc/cargo_cult_science.html) he gave at Caltech where he used to teach. Dig.
