	<p><a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/002784.html">Interesting interview transcript</a> concerning human changes in the coming few-dozen years as <a href="http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~phoenix/vinge/vinge-sing.html">technology</a> enables mankind to technologically augment itself like never before. You are already familiar with a form of the distopian wing of the notion if the Terminator movies made sense to you. I can&#8217;t think of any films that take place in a world where positive things have resulted in the aftermath of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity">singularity</a> unless you want to count <a href="http://www.imdb.com/Title?0096928">Bill & Ted&#8217;s Excellent Adventure</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<b>Hughes</b>: And it&#8217;s one technology that&#8217;s very troubling because when people are able to permanently change their own motivations, and what they consider to be important, how do we preserve individual choice and freedom? When you change your display in Windows it gives you a 10 second window in order to switch it back.
(<span class="caps">LAUGHTER</span>)
<b>Hughes</b>: When we have the ability to permanently rewire our brains to want new things we should build in that kind of fail-safe so that we switch back to our default mode and then say &#8220;now do I really want, for the rest of my life, to be a grub&#8221; or whatever it is that you&#8217;re switching yourself over into.
<b>Cascio</b>: I&#8217;m really kinda concerned about the idea of using Windows as a metaphor for any of this.
(<span class="caps">LAUGHTER</span>)
<b>Garreau</b>: Yeah, that&#8217;s the Hell scenario. A Windows crash, what an awful way to end the species.
<b>Cascio</b>: Actually that&#8217;s part of Jaron Lanier&#8217;s argument about why he doesn&#8217;t worry about the Hell scenario, is that computers are fallible. And <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/001065.html">the Singularity</a> &#8212; the robot revolution &#8212; will end with an operating system crash.
