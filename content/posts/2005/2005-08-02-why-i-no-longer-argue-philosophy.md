[The Australian Atheist Society vs. Phillip Adams](http://www.theabsolute.net/minefield/adams.html).

It reminds me of when I was 19 and would try to get theists to concede that God didn't exist based on my own arbitrary and equally worthless definition of "God" as an all-knowning, omnipotent, loving being. I now side with Adams.

Some people just need to get called assholes by friends to see that they are assholes.
