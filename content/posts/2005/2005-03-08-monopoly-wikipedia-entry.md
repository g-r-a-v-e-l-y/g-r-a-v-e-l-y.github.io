OK, no wonder I hated the game as a kid after the fun fighting-over-pieces-part...

  * Some house rules omit the auction rule. That is to say, when a player lands on an unowned property and elects not to purchase it, the property remains unowned, rather than being auctioned among the other players. This rule tends to prolong the game by delaying the formation of monopolies. Furthermore, it increases the odds for a player with good dice rolls at the start of the game; a player who gets poor rolls and doesn't land on unowned property at the start of the game can be shut out by a player who lands on more unowned property than he can buy. The official rules, in contrast, allow a cash-rich and property-poor player a better chance at competing with a player who is property-rich and cash-poor.
  * A house rule acting to increase chance and time allows players to build on a certain property only when they land on it. The game is again prolonged greatly.


**Brain**: Uh, how else would one play?

Having never actually read the rules, I always took these as cannon.

A by-the-rules Monopoly party is in order.

Any other house rules not mentioned that you were raised with? We always put any money owed anywhere that wasn't to an individual in the middle of the board to be had on a _Chance_ or whateverâ€¦
