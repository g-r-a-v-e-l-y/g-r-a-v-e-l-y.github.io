	<p>A no-brainer <small>(<a href="http://www.jokerbone.com/2005/04/19/drugs/#comment-2511">natch</a>)</small> from <a href="http://www.mindhacks.com/blog/2005/05/control_context_to_a.html">Mind Hacks</a>:</p>

	<p><blockquote>1. Pick one tune or one album that you like.</p>

	<p>2. Listen to it while you develop the code. Over and over, on repeat. Listen to no other music. Headphones are a must for the office!</p>

	<p>3. Don&#8217;t listen to it again until &#8230;</p>

	<p>4. You need to work on the same code, then listen to it.</p>

	<p>Lots of context returns with the tune and helps to write better code. One colleague suggested using scents too. Other colleagues (and my wife) just stared at me, then shook their heads sadly ;-)<br />
