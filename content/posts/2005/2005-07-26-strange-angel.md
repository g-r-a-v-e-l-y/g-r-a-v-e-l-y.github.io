Curse you, Amazon one-click used book purchases!

I just finished the [boingboing-recommended](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/07/11/book_review_strange_.html) _Strange Angel_. Get in line to borrow my copy or go buy your own - the story of the life of a pioneer in rocket science, devout Alleister Crowely follower, founder of what became the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and victim of L Ron Hubbard's pre-scientology swindles is nearly beyond words.

Now on to the next damned Amazon $4 like-new purchase: [House of Leaves](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0375703764/104-7341761-5386304?v=glance), this time on a recommendation from some stranger on the [Primer](http://primermovie.com/phpBB2/index.php) forums (go see that movie). Just flipping through, these aren't Vonnegut drawing * assholes every once in a while wierd, this is blank pages, blocks of 18pt serif in the middle of mirror reverse italic 10pt serif text followed by pages with single words off-center, color frequently used, diagonal sections followed by 30 pages of Courier with no margins. I just hope it's not all gimmick.
