The MySpace and Xanga meme's have gotten prolific enough that I've been asked about them by clients concerned about their children's online activity. I think any publishing and expression is a great thing, even if it's just another popularity contest like MySpace seems to be.

It used to be that someone like myself had to snag a geocities account, talk to n3.net about dns forwarding, wysiwyg a page design, and edit it manually. Individuals and bands now have a much easier way to attract pedophiles and stalkers, scare their parents, post nude pictures of themselves, and discover other people like themselves with fetishes for dressing up like a chipmunk in a fur suit with a cape and zoro mask.

Netiquette thoughâ€¦ [RFC 1855](http://www.dtcc.edu/cs/rfc1855.html) predates the specification for E-SMTP. The churn of new users hasn't been manageable [since September of '93](http://grantstavely.com/lol-click-here-on-this), some say. Some react a [bit harsher](http://attrition.org/news/content/05-12-31.001.html).
