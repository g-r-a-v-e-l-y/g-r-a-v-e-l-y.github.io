	<p>An afternoon of ridiculousness:</p>

	<p>I went to <a href="http://www.sunglasshut.com/sghus.cfm?dir=templates&page=home">a SunGlass Hut</a> near the office on my lunch-break today on a quest to acquire a pair of ridiculously overpriced sunglasses. I jokingly told a co-worker that they were worth it because they were made of Unobtanium. I then checked the website and found that they, in fact, were fucking made out of <a href="http://oakley.com/o/c329t">Unobtanium</a>. </p>

	<p>:ultramon:</p>

	<p>So yeah, slightly retarded but now that whole sunglasses-problem is solved for the foreseeable future. </p>

	<p>Standing in line, the girl working the brick & mortar had me fill out an index card with my name, address, e-mail address, phone number claiming that I needed to do so to buy a replacement pair of glasses at half-ridiculous-price should I break mine. I know the drill, I&#8217;m 21st Century Man, this isn&#8217;t the first time I&#8217;ve been put in a database &#8211; or in my case, polluted a database. I pushed my age up by 7 years, live in my work office and have a non-functional office number. While I&#8217;m filling mine out, another 40-something-guy in line jumped up in front of me to buy his glasses, thinking I was a sucker getting the warranty or something. </p>

	<p>&#8220;Sir, please fill out this card so that we have your information should you accidentally break your glasses you will be able to come back and get a replacement pair of glasses at half price&#8221; <- not wise advertising ridiculous-price-margins imo, also stupid.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not even from around here and I&#8217;m here because I broke a pair, that&#8217;s quite alright.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;You can take advantage of this at any Sunglass Hut sir.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care, I don&#8217;t want to be on your mailing list.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;...&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to fill it out&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Sir, I have to have you fill it out to sell you the glasses&#8221;</p>

	<p>me: &#8220;Uh.. you can just use mine man, I just put shit on it anyway ;)&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;haha, ok, I&#8217;ll use his, is that ok?&#8221;</p>

	<p>clerk: &#8220;uhh&#8230;&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Fine, you want me to fill it out, I&#8217;ll fill it out&#8221;</p>

	<p>When he walked to the counter to fill it out, she rang me up. He returned in time for me to see his card made out for <span class="caps">SMITH</span> at (555)555-5555. </p>

	<p>:dance:</p>
