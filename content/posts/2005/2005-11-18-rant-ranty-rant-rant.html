	<p><a href="http://www.rulesemporium.com/rant.html">On calling your friend the computer guy for help</a>. I will definitely go out of my way to help anyone that is in my path with computer problems &#8211; I&#8217;ve diagnosed dead drives for parking lot attendants that bring their home computers in after seeing my company car a few times and been late to clients doing it. My dad is generally very good about beer and a great meal in exchange for computer tweaking. I&#8217;ve otherwise become a hardline &#8220;drop it off at my office or house, I&#8217;ll call you when it&#8217;s ready, don&#8217;t expect that to be very soon&#8221; realist with my time. I definitely don&#8217;t build whiteboxes for people any more.</p>
