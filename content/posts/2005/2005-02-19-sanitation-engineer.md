[Ben and I](http://www.electricfork.com/) gave a lot of thought as to how to name the teams over our regular post-planning-meeting Thai lunch, given no easy way to differentiate them like location, specialty, or technical skills. My first thought was to use Gem names. My team was going to be Team Emerald, Ben was going to lead Team Ruby. Papers were drawn up, people that prepare Excel documents prepared Excel documents. During the initial brainstorm, Ben suggested star names but was shot down after he listed off a few geeky star names; boss: "Algol? nobody has heard of these things, next idea?" At another meeting, star names came up again and I suggested a few more recognizable stars (see how it was my idea? j/k) and the decision was made to change themes.

New business cards have been ordered.

Ben's team is called Team Polaris.
