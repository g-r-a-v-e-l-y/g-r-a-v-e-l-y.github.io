> **Come get this stupid cat**

> adopt him before I throw him out the window. He just got on my last damn nerve. the cat scratches and bites and shits everywehere. I'm sick of it. Litter box toys,etc, blah blah included. he's 4 years old, medium hair but sheds like a fiend. I'm just being upfront about the downsides. He isn't affectioante or real friendly. Serious inquries only please, I want to get rid of this cat soon and no this is not an ad to provoke a reaction. Send me an e-mail only if your interestd please, no angry letters, you don't know the whole story. Thanks.
