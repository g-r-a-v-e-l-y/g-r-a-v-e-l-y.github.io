My car appears to have a new door and rear quarter panel. I love that [Shannon Autobody](http://www.shannonautobody.com/) keeps work-in-progress photo gallery's up for customers.

I miss the audio system, manual transmission, handling, size, seating, climate control, sun-roof, and just about every other quantifiable thing about my RSX. Driving the Altima makes me stop at green lights out of sheer boredom. Acceleration in the (automatic) Altima turns me into Captain-Cut-You-Off while the fucking thing downshifts. The sofa that passes for a drivers seat bothers my back when driving for an hour or more. The mileage isn't great and a fill-up runs $40. Parking it is a 15-point-turn-affair in my garage spot vs. 3 for the RSX. hate, whine hate, etcâ€¦
