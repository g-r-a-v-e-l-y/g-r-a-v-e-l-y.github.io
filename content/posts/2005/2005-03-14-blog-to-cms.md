I've also moved the litestep, winamp skins, and other shit into the searchable blog system. I'm now considering reposting all old spy shots by the date they were taken. I went from proto-blogging in 99 to what I guess is a format of photo-blogging or caming which at the time I called spying by just pushing screenshots up to a website pretty regularly showing what I was up to on my machine and didn't return to text until '02\. I have a [tiny chunk](http://www.jokerbone.com/mirror/newideas/spy/spy.html) but not nearly all of the [down-to-the-second](http://www.jokerbone.com/mirror/newideas/spy/spy3.jpg) [script](/misc/mac/spy.sh).
