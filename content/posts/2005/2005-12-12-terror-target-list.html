<blockquote><br />
Local officials said Thursday they were shocked to learn that Emerald Hills Golfland, a three-acre theme park with two miniature golf courses, had been placed on a Homeland Security watch list.</p>

	<p>&#8220;The moment we realized it was on the list, it was taken off,&#8221; said San Jose police officer Rubens Dalaison, who handles &#8220;critical infrastructure assessment&#8221; for the department. &#8220;I myself took it off.&#8221;<br />
