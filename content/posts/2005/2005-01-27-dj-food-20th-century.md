Anyone manage to snag this before it was [taken offline](http://www.djfood.org/rt20c/)? Looks like he put [this book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0747557780/qid=1106830519/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-1954153-6795345?v=glance&s=books&n=507846), to a mashup.

**UPDATE**: [holy shit](http://www.boomselection.info/). Have been less than impressed by the whole mashup-scene todate. Alright, alright, you've gotten my attention. Snag the DJ Food one. [Tracklist](http://www.djfood.org/rt20c/pdf/rt20clisting.pdf).
