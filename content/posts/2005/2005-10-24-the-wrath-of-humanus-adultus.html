	<p>Since when did I stop sitting in <span class="caps">IRC</span> and talking about ops in exchange for doing &#8220;house projects&#8221;?  Seriously:</p>

<ul><li>running cable (ok, that&#8217;s geek passable)
</li><li>installing electrical outlets (still in the geek area)
</li><li>installing a chandelier (alert! alert! physical labor!)
</li><li>lawn mowing  (eek!)
</li><li>running a waterline to the refrigerator (abandon all hope now)
</li><li>help setting up drywall at a friends (but there was beer!)</li></ul>

	<p>And what do I get when I get home after installing said drywall?  &#8220;At least now you have an idea for when we start working on the basement&#8221;.</p>
