At [work](http://www.guruconsult.com/), we moved to a new office at the beginning of the month. I got upgraded from cube-vill to a center-office with windows, and a door.

A few days ago we got whiteboards.

The other team leader started using his for serious stuff - tracking projects, tech goals and deadlines, that sort of thing. I thought: Well, I don't want to track anything like that on a whiteboard, it's for brainstorming temporary stuff, I'll just put a funny picture on it.

I picked ![](/images/emot-chin101.gif). It's a guy pointing to graphs on a whiteboard (or posterboard but bear with me).

The admin staff got a huge kick out of, I didn't know why.

Today I found out that they thought I was teasing the other team leader for _his_ whiteboard contents. His text columns were the same colors as the bars on ![](/images/emot-chin101.gif)!

I erased my board (after documenting it) as soon as I found out.
