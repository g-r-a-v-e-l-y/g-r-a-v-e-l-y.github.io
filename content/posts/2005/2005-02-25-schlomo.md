[Dream analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud#Defense_Mechanisms) has as much scientific credence as [thetans](http://www.xenu.net/archive/scientology_illustrated/intro14.htm), [subluxation](http://www.dcdoctor.com/pages/rightpages_allaboutchiro/subluxations.html), [Sco's Unix claims](http://www.sco.com/), or any press release from [mi2g](http://www.mi2g.com/).

> Perhaps the most trenchant criticism of Freud's work is that it fails to have the necessary predictive and falsifiable elements required of any scientific theory. It can be argued that Freud's work is really just a narrative that can be woven around any situation that a patient might present with.
