Put best [elsewhere](http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2005/02/shmoocon-begins-i-am-happy-to-report.html):


> I left during the last presentation of the evening, which was supposed to be a sort of "hacker talk show." It was more of a train wreck than anything entertaining or informative. I will report on Saturday's talks tomorrow evening.

Saturday has been hit or miss so far. Posting from a nearly empty last impromptu 'BOF"'s of the evening before walking home. Why the only major event is a dance club and not something local I don't know.
