CRUISE: I’m a helper. For instance, I myself have helped hundreds of people get off drugs. In Scientology, we have the only successful drug rehabilitation program in the world. It’s called Narconon.
>
> SPIEGEL: That’s not correct. Yours is never mentioned among the recognized detox programs. Independent experts warn against it because it is rooted in pseudo science.
>
> CRUISE: You don’t understand what I am saying. It’s a statistically proven fact that [there is only one successful drug rehabilitation program in the world](http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Narconon/doesitwork.htm). Period.
>
> SPIEGEL: With all due respect, we doubt that. Mr. Cruise, you made studio executives, for example from Paramount, tour Scientology’s “Celebrity Center” in Hollywood. Are you trying to extend Scientology’s influence in Hollywood?
>
> CRUISE: I just want to help people. I want everyone to do well.


Interview back and forth I've never seen in the American press. :(
