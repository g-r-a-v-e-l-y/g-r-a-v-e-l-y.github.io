  * The [funsec mailing list](http://linuxbox.org/pipermail/funsec/) is pretty high volume but I'm digging it and it's a welcome addition to the often sleepy firewall-wizards subscription. My first new keeper list since the days of also being on and keeping up with spamassassin-users, exim-users, epiphany-dev, cryptogram (rss'd now), firewalls, and infosec and unsubbing from everything at once due to information overflow.
  * Theo, [House of Cosbys](http://www.channel101.com/shows/show.php?show_id=121) just found it's way to me a few months after the rest of the internet. Y'see.
  * I am now fully caught up and have no unfilled cavities. Today is the first time I've been at more than a month from a drilling in over a year and a half.
  * [Beet sugar and raisins](http://www.dogfish.com/beer/raisondetre.cfm), when done right, make a mighty fine potable. They just opened a bar near my office but happy hours are 4-6PM and I've not gotten a chance to try it.
  * [Serenity](http://www.serenitymovie.com/) would have been an amazing few years. Compressed it made for a decent action flick.
  * [Crash](http://www.empiremovies.com/movies.php?id=1787&crash.htm) was fucking terrible. Predictable surprises, poor suspense. White male review of a movie focusing on racism I guess, but I was rolling my eye's at most of the film.
  * [Alberto's](http://www.dcist.com/archives/2005/09/23/albertos_re-opens_in_dupont_circle.php) is the real deal, not a pizza bolli cardboard factory. Open till 4AM on the circle.
  * [John McLaughlin](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000009RC2/102-9875169-0541714?v=glance) has [motivated me](http://www.polarity1.com/bla62102.html) to stop using pull-off's and hammer-on's (as much) and to start picking. Let's see how long this lasts.
