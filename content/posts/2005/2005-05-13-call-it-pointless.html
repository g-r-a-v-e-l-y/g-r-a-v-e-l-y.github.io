	<p><a href="http://www.reason.com/sullum/051305.shtml">I’ve been to hell. I spell it&#8230;i spell it dmv<br />
Anyone that’s been there knows precisely what I mean<br />
Stood there and I’ve waited and choked back the urge to scream<br />
And if I had my druthers I’d screw a chimpanzee-call it pointless</a><br />
– Les Claypool </p>
