What a lot of us non believers keep to ourselves: [SomethingAwful attacks religion and the state](http://www.somethingawful.com/articles.php?a=2595) - it doesn't even seem to get to ranty or over the top until nearly 2/3 of the way down when the funny starts.

For those of you thinking this Under God rah-rah is a right wing trick, think again. Furious googling has failed to turn up anything but of a lot of partisan ranting but I've heard it convincingly argued on C-Span (haha) using statistics on a four-year basis comparing Bush and Clinton and Bush I and Reagan and so on that mentioning the big G, having a prayer at the end of a speach, or some other similar theist hoo-hah, while slightly on the rise since the 70's has not statistically differed from president to president, party to party.

fine print: The point at which I care isn't when God is mentioned, appeal to the masses all you want, just keep your Creationism out of the public schools, keep the ten commandments out of court houses, **allow** prayer in school but don't mandate it or the Pledge of Allegiance, and so on.
