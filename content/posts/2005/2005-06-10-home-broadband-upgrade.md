Broadband included in every unit!

I've been putting up w/ the shared USLEC T1 in my apartment for months now. I don't mind the latency, the 1.5/1.5 line split 40 ways was unbearable most weekends and OK most other times, provided I didn't want to steal from the **AA's, haha, or uh, download anything else. The building LAN is VLAN'd in such a way that I get a pretty garaunteed 12K down most of the time. Lately the DNS has turned to shit, and I've been annoyed at the double-dialup speeds having had cable for the past five years in every other apartment.

[The Solution](http://www.speakeasy.net/business/onelink/package?speed=60768&service=NA).

8 static IP's, 6M/768k, 150 hours a month nationwide dial-up service (for Amanda).
