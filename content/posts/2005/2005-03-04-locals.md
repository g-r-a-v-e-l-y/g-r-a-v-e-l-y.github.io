I've been grabbing feeds from a few locals recently and will be adding more until swamped. Recommendations?

  * [DCist](http://www.dcist.com/)
  * [DC SOB](http://dcsob.smorgasblog.com/)
  * [A Ten, A Five, and Five Ones](http://www.zoemitchell.com/) Yuppie foodstamp reference?
  * [DCFoodies](http://www.dcfoodies.com/)
  * [DC Blogers](http://www.dcbloggers.com/) I know it's petty but every once in a while I'll run down the list and open all of the ones with their own domain name
  * [In Shaw](http://www.inshaw.com/)
  * [Upcoming.org](http://upcoming.org/calendar/metro/64)
