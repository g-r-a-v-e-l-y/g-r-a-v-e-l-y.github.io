The owners of [Urinal.net](http://www.urinal.net/unnamed_resort_on_marco_island/) have been served a [few times](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20050105/0132239_F.shtml) for, uhm, well, posting pictures of urinals.

I've been in [One of the bathroom's here](http://urinal.net/buffalo_billiards/) (yes, that is the DC one) but can't place the specific urinal.

My suggestion to the urinal.net guys: Try to find a domain name around the new site name [Fountain](http://www.beatmuseum.org/duchamp/fountain.html).
