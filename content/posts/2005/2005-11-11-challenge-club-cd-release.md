> Huzzah challenged fans!
>
> We are finally done our CD and will be having a giant fun CD release show on November 26th at the Talking Head.
>
> That's the Saturday after Thanksgiving so you'll have two full days of gluttonous recovery before the show.
>
> We'll get back to you when all the details are shored up but make sure you hold that date now and mark it down and make necessary travel arrangements as flights will start to fill up once the word hits the street if you take my meaning.
>
> Stay mysterious,
-CC
