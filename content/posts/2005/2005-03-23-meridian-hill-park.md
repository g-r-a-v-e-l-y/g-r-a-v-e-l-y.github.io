No point here, just a 'this happened to me' story:

Two days ago, I'm skateboarding downhill on the sidewalk, park-side, of 16th St. By the halfway point down the hill the grade is steep enough that I stop pushing and just relax at a good pace and let gravity do the work. At the 3/4 point along the length of the park heading south, I notice some commotion around where the "th" in "16th" is in the map pictured.

A man backs into my path on the sidewalk with his hands up. A flashlight flickers up the street in my direction and then goes out. The man with his hands up walks out of vision again into the park as I register what is going on and decide that slowing down, which I normally do to keep from careening into Florida Avenue, might not be worth bothering with. I shot past the park's south entrance, wheels screaming, and looked to my left to see a cop arresting the guy with a bit of resistance. I realized where I was and snapped out of watching, quickly looked to my right to make sure no cars were coming across Florida. Coast clear, I shot across Florida and pulled into the driveway at John and Ben's building.
