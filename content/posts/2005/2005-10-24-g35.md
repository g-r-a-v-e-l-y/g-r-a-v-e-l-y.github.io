My work vehicle for the first three months or so was my personal 1991 Corolla. It did OK but for half that time the exhaust pipe had a hole in it near the catalytic converter so it sounded like I'd riced it out. I worked out OK at [work](http://www.guruconsult.com/) and landed myself a company car - a 2001 Ford Focus ZX3. Not a bad upgrade! I drove the Focus for two years and went through two fuel filters before the lease ran out.

The next leased vehicle was a 2003 Acura RSX. Not the sport package but finally, a 5-speed.

The RSX was involved in two not-at-fault accidents - [hit once](http://www.jokerbone.com/2005/05/01/2-more-weeks/) in [DC](http://www.jokerbone.com/2005/04/14/bumper-cars/) and driven [into a tree by a four-year-old](http://www.jokerbone.com/2005/09/28/4-year-old-boys-cant-drive/) in the burbs. Racking up 55k miles in 2 years, I was getting tired of the car and about to go over on the lease mileageâ€¦

Friday I got the replacement company car:

Not a bad upgrade - a 2004 Infiniti G35 Auto-tragic with leather seats, and the Navigational GPS package.
