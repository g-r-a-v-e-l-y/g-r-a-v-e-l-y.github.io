So I want a new guitar. The '93 [Mexican Strat](http://www.craigsmusic.co.uk/images/e37.jpg) (stock) I saved minimum wage dollars to buy used has lasted me almost 10 years. I can afford better.

Last night I tried out two guitars at a [local shop](http://www.chucklevins.com/):

**2005 Gibson Les Paul Studio**
