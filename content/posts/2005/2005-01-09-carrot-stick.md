PJ, our kitten, is crafty.

His latest trick is to hold one of his favorite toys (feathers on a stick) by the handle, in his mouth. He then chases the feathers, which much to his surprise apparently, he is of course incapable of ever catching.


**The feather and stick toy must be approached with great caution. **

**The proper chase method can be executed in just two easy steps.

Step 1: Place the small handle end in mouth. **

**Step 2: Chase the feathers at top speed.
Step 2 corollary: If the feather approaches an obstacle, turn left or right. The feather will turn too. This is magic. **
