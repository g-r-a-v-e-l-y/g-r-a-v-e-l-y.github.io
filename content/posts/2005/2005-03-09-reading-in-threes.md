[David Foster Wallace's](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&c2coff=1&q=%22david+foster+wallace%22+%22infinite+jest%22&spell=1) _Infinite Jest_: Recommended by [Erk](http://www.livejournal.com/users/rotnmusic/). Loving it so far, still early on.

Edward Tufte's _[Envisioning Information_](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_ei): Halfway through. I wanted _The Visual Display of Quantitative Information_ but the bookstores I checked didn't have them and I have no patience. I'm looking forward to the next every-day-use of a stem and leaf plot. That should say something.

[Kevin Mitnick's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Mitnick) <strike>Uh, latest silly hacker book. I don't remember the title and it isn't on kevinmitnick.com anywhere easy to find, what gives?</strike> _[Art Of Intrusion_](http://www.mitnicksecurity.com/aoi_reviews.php): Hyped, not nearly as good as the last one, which isn't saying much. Borrow my copy, don't waste your money. Oh, I used to make fun of Quake clan pages that had q1 graphics and red text on black backgrounds. Yay red text on black backgrounds. Still trite.

**Bonus**: [David Allen's](http://www.davidco.com/) [Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0142000280/102-4481179-9146548): I've not gotten this done yet. There is always something that pops up or whatever… Maybe I should get a book on time management, or maybe something about seeing things through to the end. Hrmm… Recommended. I said "open loops" the other day in a meeting. Fucking open loops man. All this managing is going to my head.
