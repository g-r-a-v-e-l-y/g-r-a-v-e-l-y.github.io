I opened an account with [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com/Default) Monday morning and snagged three movies that I had a mild interest in seeing. A day later they were in my mailbox. Last night we watched The Manchurian Candidate. Tonight I have episodes IV and V of the Star Wars series, which the geek in me [refuses to buy](http://www.jokerbone.com/2004/02/12/1983-where-are-you/) for the fifth time but the child in me really wants to see on DVD w/ my adult HiFi audio rig.

Back to [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com/Default): Wow. This is how it should be done.

Back to The Manchurian Candidate: I stopped reading Dean Koontz novels around the end of middle-school, is this one of his post-1992 novels? Contrived. Would have made a better comedy. If you liked it, go rent Jacob's Ladder, which leaves all the weak midichlorian-type specifics to your imagination and is much more successful because of it.
