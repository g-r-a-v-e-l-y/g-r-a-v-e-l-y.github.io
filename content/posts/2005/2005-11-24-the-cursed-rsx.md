I no longer have an RSX. Ethan helped me pull out all of the audio gear I'd piled into it to replace the very sub-par stock sound system. The component speakers and head-unit have been claimed, I figure the sub should go quickly at [clubRSX](http://www.clubrsx.com/) or some similar place.

The car was cursed.

  * A few weeks after I got it, shifting into fifth gear became very difficult - I think I was less than gentle with the gearbox but only ever driven stick in cars with over 100k miles on original equipment and I didn't know any better. It's been explained to me that the synchro for both third and fifth gear are no longer mint but it is pretty consistent now, after scareing the shit out of me at the time.
  * Amanda put a scrape in the right quarterpanel using a cinder-block wall and reverse against my "YOU ARE TOO CLOSE TO THE WALL!" advise from the passenger seat.
  * I backed into a 14" PVC pipe and punched out the left tail-light, costing me a few hundred dollars, trying to get "just-right" in my tight parking spot.
  * Another evening, I backed into a concrete pillar and put a vertical mark in the bumper because Amanda swore the loft was flooding and all of our storage space was being water damaged (not the case).
  * I was [hit on NY Ave](http://www.jokerbone.com/2005/04/14/bumper-cars/) requiring a new left door and quarter panel.
  * A [client's son rolled it into a tree](http://www.jokerbone.com/2005/09/28/4-year-old-boys-cant-drive/) requiring a new front bumper and lights and hood touchup.

I normally would not care in the least, cosmetic damage on a car gives it character right? Wrong, it costs money because the car is leased and I have to return it in mint condition. :cry:

The car also attracted parking tickets with a force I can't explain with any physical or logical model.

The salesman driving it now called me Friday night - it hadn't been to the body shop for the rear bumper damage yet because of the separate body work getting done on the front thanks to the four-year-old. He'd just been rear-ended. He was totally fine and the car was totally fine but it needs a new rear-bumper now.

Stock body pieces: right (scratched) quaterpanel, roof (mint), hood (slightly dented by a rock on the beltway). trunk/spoilter (mint).

Stock pieces on my last work laptop: Power supply. Which should be replaced as the fan is bad and noisy.
Replaced components: Everything else; keyboard, screen, motherboard, RAM, CPU, case.
