	<p>I know it reads like /. <span class="caps">IRC</span>, but not-invented-here cynicism and reinventing-the-wheel grumbling are what geeks <strong>do</strong> between all the SF and keeping sofa&#8217;s and computer chairs from floating away. </p>

	<p>Ars just put up a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/guides/other/msh.ars/1">Guided Tour of the Microsoft Command Shell</a>.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m impressed, <a href="http://www.jokerbone.com/2004/03/07/windows-longhorn/">For the first time</a>.</p>

	<p>Does anything like this exist for Unix? Sure, ruby and php and Python all have shells that operate very similarly but command line tinkering is not the focus of any of them. </p>
