The daylight [only gets longer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_solstice) now. Erk [pointed out](http://www.jokerbone.com/2005/09/22/merry-autumnal-equinox/) this year that my [celebration of observable solar phenomenon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_worship) is oppressive to flat-earthers. I say humbug to you flat-earthers! You can't keep me down, [geocentrists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_geocentrism)!
