[How to reset the windowserver preferences in OSX so that your external monitor that claims it is being overdriven and turns itself off](http://paco.to/blog/000049.html). It worked.

It is very bizarre to log into a mac using the GUI and be dumped into a vt100 console. The console seemed to work fine but meta-keys and commands in vim went apeshit. Ben helpfully suggested tweaking my TERM settings from xterm-color to vt100 which solved the vim problem. Back to dual head goodness :)
