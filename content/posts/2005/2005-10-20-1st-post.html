	<p>I&#8217;ve took down my blog months ago as I&#8217;m just not the kind of guy who considers himself to be a &#8220;blogger&#8221;.  But every now and then an idea will bubble up to where I must jot it down for the Internets to discover.  So watch out for that author line in the posts.  It could be one of mine.  Then again it&#8217;ll be obvious as it&#8217;ll either be security related or consist of a bad pirate joke.</p>

	<p>Hi my name is Ben, and I&#8217;m just posing like a blogger.  harrrg!</p>
