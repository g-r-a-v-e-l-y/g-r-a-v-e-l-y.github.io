Most geeks have specialties or focuses - in a large part due to the differences in how our brains function. I'm a very narrative person and have a poor memory for terminology, numbers, dates, times, etcâ€¦ This makes for me being really bad at some things but I'm a quick learner at others.

[This narative introducing kerberos](http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/dialogue.html), the centralized authentication system 9/10 of you use every day at work on windows NT networks, reads like a Dick and Jane children's novel, only I learned something. Cool.
