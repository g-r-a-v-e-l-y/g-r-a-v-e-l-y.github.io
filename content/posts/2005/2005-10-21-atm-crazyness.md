Whenever I'm at the ATM, or any checkout line nowadays, I feel very tinfoil hat paranoid. I Typically cover the number pad as I hit my pin and I typically will look around for any cameras that may be pointed at the numberpad in order to obtain PINs. I've done this for years. But as the saying goes, just because I'm paranoid doesn't mean they're not after me.

(Yes, that's a card reader in order to obtain the card magnetic codes). The entire series (including the camera to obtain your PIN) can be viewed over [here.](http://electricfork.com/images/random/atmfraud/)
