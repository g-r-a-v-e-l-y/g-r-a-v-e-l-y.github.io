A handful of people that visit have never actually been over (irl), so uh, yeah.

I'm working on an [Automator action](/misc/mac/spy.zip) that replaces my old [screenshot + thumbnail + upload + clipboard copy scrip](/misc/mac/spy.sh)t. It works great in automator but when you save it as an app the dynamic actions that rename the file based on the date and time seems to get skipped. I'm an Automator newb, still looking into it.
