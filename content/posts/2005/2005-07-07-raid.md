Paul: lmao
Paul: caught a cockroach off the floor here… shoo'd it into an empty water bottle w/ a piece of paper.. stuck some leaves and sticks in there, a piece of a potatoe chip, and put a cap full of water in it.. cut air holes in it and taped it sideways to the top of my monitor. Always wanted a pet at work!
Grant: oh dear
Paul: it just needs a name.. was thinking Raid…. geeky, a pun, and it's catchy!
Grant: very
Paul: He'll be raid1, and when he dies..
Paul: and so on

Paul: my new pet is really boring

Paul: I should get him a little plastic ball to run around the room in:) lol

Three weeks later:

Grant: How's raid0 doing?
» still alive?
Paul: yeah.. I cut the lid off another bottle's cap and attached the two bottles together, so now he has a condo.
Grant: I can't believe he's lived this long
