[Another PKD story optioned by hollywood](http://www.philipkdick.com/films_scanner.html). Does this cast look crazy enough for you?

Keanu Reeves as Fred/Bob Arctor
Rory Cochrane as Freck
Robert Downey Jr. as Barris
Woody Harrelson as Luckman
Winona Ryder as Donna

I intentionally try to avoid any celebrity drama and even I am a bit scared of combining acidic Harrelson, Ryder, and Downy Jr. with a base Reeves. It just sounds too much like something in the Anarchist's cookbook with four common things and one really hard to find thing that when combined will melt through an engine block. What's the antithesis of a super-group?

Fred/Bob indeed.
