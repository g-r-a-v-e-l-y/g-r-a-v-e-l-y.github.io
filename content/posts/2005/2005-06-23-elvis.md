Hello, I'm Grant, and I'm a big Elvis Costello fan. On a whim I download his first album to see what all the fuss about. Amazing.

I wasn't worried back when I decided last year that _Let It Be_ was the my favorite album of all time very much especially The End, after all, it's a classic. I didn't notice getting into Echo & the Bunnymen, starting to take Bowie seriously, or my recent penchant for 'majory-stuff' (Wilco and their ilk).

Elvis Costello?

WTF. I was into Minor Threat and NIN and RATM and Ministry, man. I was angry about, shit, and stuff, or somethingâ€¦

The next time I roll my eye's at Mom going to a Yanni show after growing up playing Hendrix albums, I'll remember that she was also a Steely Dan fan, and be a bit more introspective.
