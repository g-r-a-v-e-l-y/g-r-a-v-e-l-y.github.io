Nothing like a mid-week drive to Baltimore, I've always said.

> The Challenge Club mailing list is up and running. We also have a spot on the web all picked out at [www.challenge-club.com](http://www.challenge-club.com/) and site designing is underway but about all you can see there now is a pleasant picture of Billy.

> But the more pressing news item is that we are playing at The Royal this Thursday night and it will be your last chance to see us for at least a month so dont let it pass you by!!! Doors open at 8 and we are playing second. The Royal is located on 1542 Light St in Federal Hill. If you want more info than that you should go to <http://theroyalbaltimore.com/>.
