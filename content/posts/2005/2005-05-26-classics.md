A birdie gave me [a 24 half-hour lecture series](http://www.learnoutloud.com/Catalog/Literature/Ancient-and-Medieval-Classics/Classical-Mythology/2611) on Classical Mythology by Elizabeth Vandiver.

I highly recommend it.

Prometheus (a Titan) gave mankind all sorts of fancy shit we need like numbers, the alphabet, ships, and best of all, fire, which he stole from Zeus. Zeus had him tied to a pillar where an eagle could come peck-out his liver every day. Man, alone at this point in the world, was punished for this mess by being given the curse of women - Pandora being the first.

Makes sense to me!
