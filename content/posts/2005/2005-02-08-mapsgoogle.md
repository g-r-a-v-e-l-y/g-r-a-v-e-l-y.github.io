[Yay](http://maps.google.com).

I can't decide what I think of the cludge that they are using to link to a map while during the query process keeping it all out of the url. It looks like the only extra data on the [link](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=2633%2016th%20st.%20nw%20washington%20dc) is the level of zoom/pan.

I love the pan-ability.
