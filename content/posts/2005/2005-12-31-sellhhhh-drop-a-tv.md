I posted my old 27" TV on craigslist. A week passed before an excited buyer came over to take it off my hands. I showed her that it indeed worked wonderfully by playing a few seconds of Sonic the Hedgehog on it, then we unplugged it and carried it down to her car.

We made it to the driveway in front of my building and set it down so that she could open the car door when the TV made a run for it. When we set it down, it wasn't on perfectly flat ground, and was front-heavy. The TV tipped over onto it's face and the picture tube blew with a nice BOOMPHSHISSSSSSSSSSSSSsssss.

The buyer wasted driving down to pick it up, and I'm out the $50 I was going to charge her for it. I apologized and carried it down to the dumpster with Amanda's help.
