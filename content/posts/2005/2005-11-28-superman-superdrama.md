[The making of Superman V](http://www.agonybooth.com/forum/topic2730.htm) is getting a lot of links out there today and yesterday. I've never been a comics reader but always enjoy the Films. I was aware of Kevin Smith's involvement but thought it had died after that. Intriguing.

Edit: It's really really long.
