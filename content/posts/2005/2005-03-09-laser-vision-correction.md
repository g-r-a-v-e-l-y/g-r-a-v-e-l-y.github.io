Grant: talking to _Anonymous_ at _Anonymous laser vision correction office_ client of yours
» lcd unit bad » had it fixed » any idea how to focus their projector » ?
Ben: focus it? uh
Grant: yeah » talking to _Anonymous_
Ben: move the projector towards the wall? » never used their projector. its like a typical inFocus one though
Grant: right
--/-- snip
Grant: I have to say, the irony here is delicious » seeing as how they do laser eye surgery » they should just give the lecture with it out of focus, then sign people up for eye exams and then laser surgery » brilliant
Ben: yea, maybe she'll go for that
