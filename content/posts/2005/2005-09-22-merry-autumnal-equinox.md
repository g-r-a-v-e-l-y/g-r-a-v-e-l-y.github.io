Today we celebrate a day that is reliably predictable and observable - the [autumnal equinox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox). Let us all share bad Falling-into-Fall jokes, remember our indian summers, our changing leaves, and share in a holiday that atheists, jews, christians, and muslims, asses and elephants, and rich and poor people would have to deny observation to disagree on!

:jihad: WINTER ADVISORTY LEVEL BROWN! REPORT SUSPICIOUS BAROMETER READINGS! BE SURE TO CARRY PARKAS, SUN SCREEN, AND DUCT TAPE -- BE PREPARED! IF YOU LEAVE THE A/C ON IN THE FALL, THE SOUTHERN-HEMISPHERISTS WIN! :911:

(oh it was a nice post until it had to get all :tinfoil:)
