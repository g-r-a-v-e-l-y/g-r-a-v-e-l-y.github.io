	<p>A while back I thought it would be fun to pick up one of those mind puzzle books to wet my noodle.  &#8216;Lo and Behold: I work a block away from Barns & Noble <em>and</em> happen to have a gift-card burning a hole in my wallet.</p>

	<p>I picked up <a href="http://www.cryptogramsbylouise.com/CADay.htm">Cryptogram A-Day Book</a> for $7.00.  The almighty google says:</p>

<blockquote>A cryptogram is a type of word puzzle popularly printed in some newspapers and magazines. A short piece of text is encrypted with a simple substitution cipher in which each letter is replaced by a different letter. To solve the puzzle, one must recover the plaintext. This is usually done by frequency analysis and by recognizing letter patterns in words.</blockquote>

	<p>I didn&#8217;t actually realize it was just substitution when I picked it up.  Kinda boring, really.  I hacked up a quick <a href="http://electricfork.com/src/cryptogram.txt">perl script</a> to (theoretically) make it easier to find the plaintext.  So far I haven&#8217;t put much effort into it.  Feel free to give it a shot:<br />
