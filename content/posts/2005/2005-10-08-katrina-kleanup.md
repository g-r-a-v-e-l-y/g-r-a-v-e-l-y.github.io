My Dad just got back from a week or so in NO helping his friend Kirk get his air conditioner running again, cleaning house, and doing general fix-up stuff. I was invited but my boss called my cell immediately upon receiving the e-mail request for a no-notice week straight of work off to laugh at me.

The mold was apparently very very bad, as was the heat. Most places are closed due to lack of staffing - the local Burger King was advertising a $6k signing bonus and nearly double salary for applicants.
