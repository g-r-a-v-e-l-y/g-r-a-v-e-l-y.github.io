An [ogm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogm) of [Deleted Magic](http://www.starwarz.com/deletedmagic/), a re-edit of Star Wars episode IV full of alternate takes, cut scenes, and auditions found it's way to me half a year stale last night.

Not only did [Han shoot first](http://www.jokerbone.com/2004/02/12/1983-where-are-you/), he had a pretty lady at the table before the action started and got rid of her for business and all the actors on Tatooine were British and overdubbed to lose the accents (think: everyone in the Cantina scene, nobody in an Imperial uniform excluding Vader).
