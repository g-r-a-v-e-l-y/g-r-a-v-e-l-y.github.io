Last week I was working for a fire alarm vendor fixing their VPN / redoing their firewall policy (Juniper Netscreen for those interested, with an LOL "[permit - permit] on the [untrust -> trust] chain") in the same room that they test fire alarm equipment: the rest of the room is surrounded by wall-mounted circuit boards with das blinken-lightzen and wire leads running everywhere. This room contains all of the models the vendor installs I guess, ready for testing. Each device beeps evvery few seconds, for what reason I can't even begin to guess.

The last time I was stuck in an environment with enough noise-polution that I recorded and posted it was my college roomate snoring.

These beeps got really old but I found that if I didn't think about them (silly notion QUICk DON"T THIK ABOUT A PINK ELEPHANT!) they just disappeared into the background noise and I was able to focus just fine. Thank-you Play this as loud as possible on repeat for four hours. Yes, that's XM top-tracks in the background, piped through the whole office. I complained about it to another tech enough that I know that in addition to the Credence (hate), I also was tortured with Billy Joel's "Movin' Out (anthony's song)" (-ack-ack-ack-ack-ack-ack shoot me) and STYX "Come Sail Away".

Oh, and I type fast in the end.
