I'm on the homestretch to complete _Words and Music: a history of pop in the shape of a city_ by Paul Morley.

I'm checking out _Words and Music_ because of the sampled readings in [dj food's Raiding the 20th Century expansion](http://www.djfood.org/rt20c/) [(previously on jb)](http://www.jokerbone.com/2005/01/27/dj-food-20th-century/). I just deleted a few lines describing it, started over, and repeated. It is one part history of the 20th century, part [Connections](http://smithsonianassociates.org/programs/burke/burke.asp) for art and music geeks (hope you know your -isms), and part editorial poetry. It is hard to describe.

I'm making slower progress on [House of Leaves](http://www.jokerbone.com/2005/07/26/strange-angel/) consequently. ![book cover for house of leaves](/images/holt.jpg) but it is refreshing to read a novel, strange as it is.
