Just finished [The Cuckoo's Egg](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0743411463/qid=1127875808/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-9875169-0541714?v=glance&s=books&n=507846). Pre-morris worm haxoring! The closest anything came to a mention of Redmond was a flippant reference to "DOS" about twice, amongst many other PC OS's. Ben suggested it, good/fast read. Pre Chaos Club! Pre-BBS! NYT best seller, yadda-yadda.

PS: I love that amazon lists this: [The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security by Steve Wozniak](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00007K3ZN/ref=pd_sim_b_1/102-9875169-0541714?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v=glance) as if Woz wrote it. :woz: What a fucking terrible book. Erâ€¦ FREE KEVIN...
