	<p>I&#8217;ve finally gotten my pics developed from SC05. I&#8217;m pretty disappointed as I&#8217;m not in <i>any</i> of them. They should make great google-fodder though, as there are a bunch of group shots as well as pics of people I don&#8217;t know.</p>



	<p>...and the <a href="http://www.jokerbone.com/photos//main.php?g2_view=core:ShowItem&g2_itemId=4421">rest of my gallery</a>.</p>

	<p>Or check out the gallery from <a href="http://electricfork.com/images/santacrawl2005/santacrawl2005.html">Ben&#8217;s pics</a>, which you&#8217;ll want to see as I&#8217;m actually in them :)</p>

	<p>Additionally there is <a href="http://pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/zirzlo/album?.dir=/7ad5&.src=ph&.tok=phV3lCEB9sHsHAs2">this gallery</a> from a random Santa friend of a friend.</p>

	<p>And <a href="http://www.jokerbone.com/2004/12/06/santacrawl-04/">my pics from 2004&#8217;s crawl</a></p>
