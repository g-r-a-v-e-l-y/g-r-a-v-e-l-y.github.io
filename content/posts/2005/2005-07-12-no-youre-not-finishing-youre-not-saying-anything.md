Of course every time I turn on c-span anymore it's always Today in Washington followed by pre-recorded call-in segments, at least the reason for that is because I no longer have the daily commute from hell. :)

Skim this [White house press corps vs. Scott McClellan](http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/07/20050711-3.html) transcript for an interesting communications lesson.
