After years of resistance to getting an Ipod, I finally picked up the 60GB Ipod Photo. Burning CD's every morning has been getting old for months, I never label them, often remix them / reburn them, and my head-unit pauses 3 seconds between mp3 tracks (Abbey Road; tarnished!).

Boring bio part: I didn't get a car for my 16th birthday. I wasn't even allowed to get my license until I was 17 & a half. I did on the other hand get a job at 15 and 3/4 or whatever the legal minimum was. Most of that income went to CD's, and I've been carying hundreds around in bags for the past 8 years, from house to car to work and back: a bag with every Zeppelin , Floyd, Hendrix, and Beatles album, a bag with every Fugazi, Pearl Jam, Wilco, and Radiohead record plus assorted similar stuff, a bag with every Nine Inch Nails, Chemical Brothers, and Ninjatune release plus assorted electronica. And so onâ€¦

Getting a 10GB or 20GB ipod seemed kinda silly. I'd still be carrying four bags around, plus the ipod. A 60GB should do me for a while. Paired with the 250GB firewire drive I picked up a few months ago I now have a pretty silly portable data capacity.
