I took off today to finish up packing for the move but have been playing [this game](http://fusoya.panicus.org/projects.html) instead.

It is ridiculously hard - I'm using save-state cheats on the modded-xbox and still getting baffled by a few of the maps. Every nasty trick mario has had to do is required to defeat nearly all the maps. Flying to get keys to hold P switches to make jumps that are only possible by bouncing off a flying turtle where there are moving platforms blocked by columns of impassable stone.

**Update**: I've made it past the third castle and haven't missed a secret exit yet, but I'm cheating like a fiend with save-state do-overs. The secret exit on Desert World 4 was very lame / took forever to figure out.
