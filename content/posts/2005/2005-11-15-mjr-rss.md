[MJR](http://www.ranum.com/) has an [RSS feed](http://www.ranum.com/index.rss20) now.

Headlines only.

I can only assume it's because he didn't care enough to configure it, wrote the feed generator himself and stopped at "functional", or the log-watcher in him wants to keep hit counts accurate. A younger-me probably would have ranted about the frame based site and font=arial tags, [and it's still an asshole-move pointing it out in a statement about not pointing that sort of thing out anymore](http://www.jokerbone.com/2005/08/02/why-i-no-longer-argue-philosophy/), Captain Manipulative.
