Who listens to [Clutch](http://www.pro-rock.com/v6/main.html) for the lyrics? I don't. Clutch brings the rock. ![](/images/emot-banjo.gif)

So I'm checking out [Robot Hive / Exodus](http://drt-entertainment.com/media_services/CLUTCHrobotCDMINI.jpg), where the second song is called [10001110101](http://www.theskull.com/javascript/ascii-binary.html). It doesn't convert to ASCII. Shit. Is the [decimal conversion](http://www.tonymarston.net/php-mysql/converter.php) at least interesting? Does 1141 mean anything to you?

Moving on…


>
> Ribonucleic acid freak out, the power of prayer.
> Long halls of science and all the lunatics committed there.
> Robot Lords of Tokyo, SMILE TASTE KITTENS!
> Did you not know that the royal hunting grounds are always forbidden?
>
> Are you rolling tape now? Bits and pieces large and small
> Sector, vector, eat them all.
> Its already in their eyes.
> Among the metal ones a messenger will soon arrive.
>
> 10001110101
> Periodic table with a center piece of mind.
> 10001110101
> Periodic table with a center piece of mind.
>
> ….

Wait, SMILE TASTE KITTENS, now I'll forgive the binary completely.

**UPDATE** Oh neat: The song is actually _100,011,10101_, which is binary for 4, 3, 21. Which also makes no sense.
