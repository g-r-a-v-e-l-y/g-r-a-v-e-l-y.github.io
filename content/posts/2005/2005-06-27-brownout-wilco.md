[My building](http://www.wardermansion.com/) had a brownout from about 4:45 last night to 6 this morning. As bad as the leasing office staff here is, and they are very very bad, I think they would have put out notice were it for planned maintenance. The strange thing is that the power never went out in the living room. I was playing guitar when it went out, along with the stereo, and never noticed. My building-provided internets lost connectivity. Amanda noticed the washing machine wouldn't turn back on. The lights in the bathroom were no brighter than matches. The AC, and this is most annoying, was out.

We then left to see Wilco at Merriweather. The elevator was out, the basement lights were out. Awesome.

A group of kids parked themselves sans-blankets on the lawn in front of just us as the Roots, who's set consisted of covering 70's songs while unintelligibly rapping over them, were finishing their terrible godawful set to ask us â€“ you know if you want to hear Whole Lotta Love, Black Betty, and a terrible bass solo, look no further. The best part of their set was when the singer took a break and let the backup signer and guitar player have a straight up 12-bar blues song. I'd go so far as to say it was the only part of their set that wasn't utter shit. I'd rather hear a DJ mix the actual songs they covered with quality rapping over it than this hip wedding-band. So anyway, to ask us,

"Did we miss The Roots?"
"Yeah man."
"Damnit, that's who we are here to see. So who's left?"
"Wilco"
"Are they any good? I like weird stuff, what are they like?"
me, to myself: Weird like The Roots?
"They are like, alt-country pop music"
John: "Kinda Beatle'sie, not alt-country anymore"
Me: "Well, right."
kid's girlfriend: "I heard they were like, indie."
me: "oh yeah, very indie" :rolleye:

...later:

kid: How are the cops?
me: Assholes, everywhere (:tinfoil:)
kid: Everywhere?
me: Oh you mean here right now? I haven't seen any.
kid: Guess I should wait till the sun goes down ;), you know ;)
me: uh, yeah.
