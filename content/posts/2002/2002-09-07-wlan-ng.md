Ladies and gentlemen, I am now officially wireless. Thanks Paul for the wlan-ng help and Jeff for the free 3com Access Point.

Paul helped me get my wireless pcmcia card working in gentoo. I got up this morning and swapped the living-room hub with the hub in my bedroom (needed the uplink port) and plugged in the access point. I then brought up `/etc/init.d/pcmcia` and `/etc/init.d/wlan`. I was still configured for the _guru_ SSID but that would soon change. The only problem was, Jeff never told me how he'd configured the AP before giving it to meâ€¦ I had my fingers crossed for WEP to be turned off but it really wouldn't have mattered that much.

```shell
> airsnort
```

"Oh, neat, scan." **click**

Airsnort saw the AP and I quickly put it's name in `/etc/wlan.conf` and restarted `/etc/init.d/wlan`.

```shell
> dhcpcd wlan0
> /etc/init.d/net.eth0 stop
```

`/me unplugs cat5`

Now if only there were a way to make batteries wireless - using the wireless pcmcia card drains my batteries in ~45 minutes.
