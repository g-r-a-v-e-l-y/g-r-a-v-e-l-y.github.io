I was [googling](http://www.wordspy.com/words/google.asp) for documentation on [yelp](http://www.gnome.org/softwaremap/projects/Yelp), the gnome man/info/help browser to see if it was possible to use it as an alias for xman because:

* xman is ugly
* `yelp --help` output doesn't seem to offer any flags
* ```shell
  > man yelp
  No manual entry for yelp
  ```
* The [gman](http://freshmeat.net/projects/gman/?topic_id=58) ebuild fails on my laptop and the authors site doesn't exist
* I have too much slack time on weekends

On the [fiifth listing of 20](http://www.google.com/search?q=yelp+man+page+info+help+documentation&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=utf-8&start=40&sa=N) I came across an SF short story by [Cory Doctrow](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/778) that I highly recommend entitled "[0wnz0red](http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/08/28/0wnz0red/print.html").

Enjoy. NB, [surfing his articles](http://www.google.com/search?q=cory%20doctorow&sourceid=mozilla-search&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8) has the potential to kill a lot of time :)
