[Old MS Hotfix instructions for IIS4](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;en-us;q297860).

To Paraphrase:

Microsoft recommends that customers running IIS 4.0 on Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition, protect their systems by uninstalling IIS 4.0.

I couldn't agree more.

I know it's somewhat silly to critisize software that old for having a crazy security hole, but one can only take so much ;)

Right now I'm looking at a dialog box caused by [this fucker](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;en-us;q327696#IIS4).

Windows NT 4.0 has been updated.   Remove any disks from the floppy disk drives and choose OK to restart your computer.

Under which is a single button labled "OK".

On a mail server that is also a file server and a web server. Be careful! Don't accidentally hit that OK button!

Stupid.
