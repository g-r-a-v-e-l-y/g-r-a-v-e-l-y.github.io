Every other Thursday night from 7 to 9 PM, I am required to be at the office for "Tech Meetings". The remaining Thursdays are listed as "Game Nights" but no one has ever actually had a 'Game Night' since I started working here four months ago.

Last night (and into this morning) we successfully had our first lan party (unnamed) at the office. It went very well but the hour drive home at 5:30 AM was definitely rough. The boss even came and spent three hours trying to get Warcraft 3 working on our LAN - taking breaks to let myself and ben own him up in Q3 matches.

Good times. Next time we'll definitely have a camera handy.
