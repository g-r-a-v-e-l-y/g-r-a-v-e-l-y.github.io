I had to move my ftp/ssh/www server + nat/firewall box. I had hoped to be able
to leave it up but it was strung through too many powerstrips.

```shell
> uptime
Linux pcp243892pcs 2.4.17 #2 Sat Jan 19 22:25:47 EST 2002 i586 unknown

14:27:35 up 102 days, 16:25, 1 user, load average: 0.02, 0.02, 0.00
```

Tears were shed.
