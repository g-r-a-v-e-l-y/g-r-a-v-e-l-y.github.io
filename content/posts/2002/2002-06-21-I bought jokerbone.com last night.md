Well, for lack of a better name, I bought jokerbone.com last night. It's not live yet but will be soon.

When it is live, I can be e-mailed at grant at jokerbone.com and you can all update your bookmarks.

It sounds so 1997 saying 'update your bookmarks'. Like back in the day when 'dynamic' sites were new ideas and taglines like hit refresh to update as content changes often and under construction animated gifs and warnings were the rage.

**sigh**
