# A1 - VIEWS OF SHOPPING CENTER PARKING LOT - SUNRISE

A silver 2001 Ford Focus pulls lazily into a parking spot directly in front of Dunken' Donuts. With the engine still running, the door pops open as the power window begins gliding up, allowing the blue curls of cigarette smoke to
continue their rise out of the vehicle into the damp morning air. Window up, the car shuts off and out steps a young man, tie loosened, hair still wet from showering, rubbing one eye with the free hand not toying with the freshly lit cigarette.

# EXT - DUNKEN DONUTS'

Cars pass and Grant walks up to the sidewalk vectored to an average 'shopping-center garden', heavliy mulched and surrounded by a curb of it's own.

# CU - Grant

Meticulously placing the nearly unsmoked cigaretted on the curb of the garden, filter side dangling, Grant tests the air for any hint of a breeze that would deem the the safe-place unsuitable. Discovering none, he glances around to see if anyone saw him saving the Camel for later and walks toward the Dunken Donuts.

# INT - DUNKEN DONUTS.

Shots of two clerks and two customers - both female, both placing large orders. The door is heard opening and Grant walks into place behind the women in line.

# CU - WOMEN.

Misc rambling - pull focus to see Grant staring holes into the back of their heads that they need baggels with toppings at a time like this.

# CU - GARDEN CURB

Cigarette has continued smoldering but is nearly out. Zoom reveals faint line of smoke still trailing.

# INT - DONUT SHOP

Women recieve breakfast to go and leave at the same time. Grant oders a coffee.

# CU - COFFEE MAKER

At this donut shop, cream is put in before the coffee. While the coffee is dropping into the cup, the clerk is positioning the lid to be secured to the styrofoam the instant the cup is full.

# CU - GRANTS HAND.

Grant counts out the 21 cents to even the change and hands it to the clerk.

# CU - GARDEN CURB

The cigarette appears out. A hand reaches down to wisk it up, it is Grant. He trotts back toward the silver focus, slightly more awake now that the coffee grabbing mission is accomplished.

# VIEWS OF CARS MANUVERING IN PARKING LOT.

The two women previously in line in front of Grant in the donut shop are in cars on either side of the focus, still jabbering as if it wasn't 7AM as Grant approches the vehicle.

# ECU - FOCUS IGNITION

Key turning.

# CU - REAR VIEW MIRROR

Vehicle begins backing out of the spot but through the mirror view, it appears to be approaching the donut shop.

# ECU - BRAKE PEDAL

Grant slams on the breaks.

# WIDE - ARIAL SHOT

Uniformed clerk from donut shop aproaches Focus with something white in his hand.

# INT - FOCUS - LOOKING AT PASSENGER WINDOW

Grant powers down the window from the drivers side and looks over to see the clerk.

# POV - CLERK
