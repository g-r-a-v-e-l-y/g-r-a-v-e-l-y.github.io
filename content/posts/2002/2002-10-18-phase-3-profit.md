When you have 10 or more geeks in an irc channel (who else would be in an irc channel) talking geek talk, invariably someone says "I wish I had my own T-1".

The general response among newbs is "I wish I had a T3!"

The educated then say something about OC-48 or whatever insane new uselessly extreme-bandwidth-gigabit-ethernet-wouldn't-know what-to-do-with is current

My laptop is currently the only thing plugged into the LAN side of a T1 that I just set up. Now that I have it, I can't think of anything to actually do with it! Blarg!
