	<p>Back when I was an art major taking an &#8216;introduction to art and digital media&#8217; class, I was given the assignment to make three animated banner advertisements.</p>

	<p>I knew the assignment was more or less a &#8220;learn the technology&#8221; piece, which was extremely aggravating for me, as were the majority of my college art classes. The first few years of art classes focus on learning the media, then focusing on the craft. The media wasn&#8217;t new to me, and I didn&#8217;t learn the craft. =/</p>

	<p>So anyway, my main banner ad was unintelligible sccribble with a red, then green, then blue background.</p>

	<p>During my review, the TA pointed out that I had chosen rgb wisely and that it makes my banner ad cool. Now I&#8217;m no better artist / mind than the TA &#8211; she, and all of the other people I interracted with are extremely talented, but I just laughed and said &#8220;I was cliche-dropping wired magazine. rgb ya know?&#8221;</p>

	<p>The so-far design of this site has been going that way so far. A parody of a designer site w/ some usability excpetions (a true parody would have 7px type somewhere). I think that, this, more than my disgust with the art department&#8217;s technology-hand-holding, was what kept me from a degree. </p>

	<p>I&#8217;m a un-creative bastard.</p>
