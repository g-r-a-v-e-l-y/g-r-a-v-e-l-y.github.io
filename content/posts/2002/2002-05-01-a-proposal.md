	<p>I just wanted to extend my congrats to Paul, who is the geekiest guy I&#8217;ve ever met that doesn&#8217;t have /anything/ on the web of his own to which I could href his name.</p>

	<p>The congrats are in order becuase he popped </p>

	<p>the question the night before last.</p>

	<p>Now his lovely gf is his lovely fiance. </p>

	<p>gl to the both of them :)</p>
