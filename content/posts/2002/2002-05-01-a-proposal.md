I just wanted to extend my congrats to Paul, who is the geekiest guy I've ever met that doesn't have /anything/ on the web of his own to which I could href his name.

The congrats are in order becuase he popped the question the night before last.

Now his lovely gf is his lovely fiance.

gl to the both of them :)
