Neat, I'm not the only freak that was obsessed with UU back in the day - [these guys are recreating
it](http://uwadv.sourceforge.net/index.php?page=screenshots)!

I wonder if just they have the same mental association that makes me think of the game whenever I hear Jane's Addiction's _Three Days_ or anything on the Smashing Pumkin's _Siamese Dream_

Making it to the 10th of 9 labyrinth levels (secret end level!) and realizing that broken piece of metal I accidentally dropped in lava on level 6 (three weeks ago in RL time) was half of the magical sword, which is the only item of the 10 magical items in the game not in my pouches (I was a mage, didn't worry about silly swords) was going to prevent me from beating the secret end of the game (I'd already saved the princess) really pissed me off. This folks, was the last good game that existed before the net… before struggling players at two in the morning could just look online for a strategy guide - although if you were to pick up UU now, you've had no problem finding step by step walkthroughs.

Good stuff - highly recommended. Oh and software-3d first-person rendering that looked better than doom2 before q1 was out - sweetness.

Right on Perry. I don't get it but the "All now with wings" part sounds cool so right on.
