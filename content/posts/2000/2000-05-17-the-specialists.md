Before it's too late to be noticable, I'd like to use this forum to give thanks to a great clan, [The Specialists](http://thespecialists.dhs.org/) for all of thier support during acid\*sun's brief unstable period. Thanks to their help and advice during that period, especially the counsel of [TS]Riffington and [TS]Hollow_Man, acid\*sun is again a growing clan. The new and imporved acid\*sun is heavily based on what we've seen and liked about how The Specialists run their organization. Nate and I will never forget them, and I look forward to joining them at QuakeCon in August. In summation, if you see a [TS] on a players name in q3a, you've just met a wonderfully nice guy - but watch out, he'll frag the shit out of you if you aren't careful ;)
