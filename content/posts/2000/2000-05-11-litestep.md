I figured I ought to post the acid\*sun [Litestep](http://www.litestep.net/) theme I've created and have been using for the past few months. If you like this [screen shot](/www/portfolio/as/litestep.jpg) let me know and I will gladly assist any "new to Litestep" users in installing it. There is an accompanying windowblinds theme, also homemade that can be seen in the screenshot. It is highly recommended that if you have little or no litestep experience that you not try to install it yourself.
