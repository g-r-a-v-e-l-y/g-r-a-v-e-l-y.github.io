What does the future hold for acid*sun? As of last night, we are practically disolved. Some are talking to the TheSpecialists, some to SMS, some are screaming at their local phone company for not offering high bandwith. I have a few ideas of my own that I would like to put on the table for the existing acid*sun members. We've all given this a lot of thought and we need to discuss things in IRC. If you no longer wish to be involved, that's fine. But please idle irc.enterthegame.com until we have all made out decissions - don't leave anyone hanging. Thank you!
