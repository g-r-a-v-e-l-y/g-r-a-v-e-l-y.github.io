Before all of this (read the previous to posts) acid*sun had scheduled a match on sunday night in honor of Mother's Day. Ok.. maybe it's not in honor of Mother's Day, but that's what you can all tell your Mothers when you stay home for the game so that we dont' have to forefeit. The match is against our good friends, The Specialists, and I know that they have been looking forward to this. One last acid*sun game? With RogerWilco? It'll make you remember the good times and why you are now leaving/staying (maybe). As usual - IRC is the best way to get a hold of any involved players and the match is at 9:00 PM Eastern.
