What to do, what to do... hmmmm... It seems like Nate, Dimi and I are the only remaining members of acid\*sun. Stereotype has left and pulled most of the other members with him. Unfortunate? Perhaps not.

We have decided to rebuild the clan instead of joining TS, although their generous offers to join were and are rather enticing. As of Saturday, I have admin control of the IRC channel and we are officially *recruiting*.  
  
There are a number of things on which one can base a clan. Some choose skill. Some choose personality. Most choose a mixture of two.  
  
acid*sun - the *new* acid*sun - will be built up on personality. Most anyone can aquire 1337 5k1llz but once an asshole, always an asshole, and we won't have any of that.
