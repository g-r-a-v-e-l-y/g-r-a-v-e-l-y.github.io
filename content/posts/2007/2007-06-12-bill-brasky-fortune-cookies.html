<p>I had a free moment and Bill Brasky quotes came to mind so I found a good source of them and made a unix fortune text and dat file package: <a href="/files/fortune-mod-brasky.tar.gz">fortune-mod-brasky.tar.gz</a>.</p>

<p class="console"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> fortune brasky<br />
His first name is Bill.<br />
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span> fortune brasky<br />
Bill Brasky is an eight foot two ton monster who can palm a medicine ball.<br />
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span> fortune brasky<br />
Did I ever tell you about the time Brasky went hunting? Well anyway, Brasky decides he's gonna hunt down all four members of the Banana Splits. He stalks and kills every one of them with a machete. They all beg for their lives, except Fleagul.

<p>Put the contents of that tarball in /usr/share/games/fortune or somewhere similar and enjoy!</p>
