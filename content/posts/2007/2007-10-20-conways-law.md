[Tufte finds Conway’s law](http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001yB&topic_id=1) frequently rearing it’s ugly head. If you’ve worked on engineering projects, or taken over for someone else’s engineering project, you’ll recognize it immediately.

> Any piece of software reflects the organizational structure that produced it.

That can be reworded to encompass any design project, software engineering or otherwise. It also is evident when an engineering team is slowly recycled with new members. The designs of the original team will be deemed crufty and most engineers joining the team will want to clean-slate the entire thing. This isn’t practical, so bolt-on and secondary systems tend to emerge. Extending existing systems is an impossible ideal.

Managers of engineering teams over this lifecycle must be understanding to guide this to fruitful ends.

Emphasis mine below.

The new car-design organization will probably consist of groups that correspond to the major components of a car: engine, body, transmission, interior, electrical, etc.

Wikipedia offers a corollary

_In every organization there is one person who knows exactly what is going on at all times. This person must be fired._

Sounds like management!

Richard: If we had someone that knew exactly what was going on in all parts of [UMBC](http://www.umbc.edu/), it’d be noteworthy, possibly worth a newspaper article in the student paper.
