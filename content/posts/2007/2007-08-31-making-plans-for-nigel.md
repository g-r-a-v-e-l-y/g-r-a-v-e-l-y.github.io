At work, [Making Plans for Nigel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Making_Plans_For_Nigel) came up on the ipod, which I blast through a [Tivoli Model Two](http://www.tivoliaudio.com/product.php?productid=144&cat=262&page=1) in our six-cube windowless office with the overhead flourescent's off because we are all nerds.

[Queue it up and play along](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oozsvIaZ9mc&mode=related&search=)!

> We're only making plans for nigel
We only want what's best for him
We're only making plans for nigel
Nigel just needs this helping hand


Awesome tune. I was probably tapping my toes, playing finger-drums on my desk.

> And if young nigel says he's happy
He must be happy
He must be happy in his work


I had to break out in a very exagerated and loud parody of the actual bridge accompaniment: "Iiiiiinnnnn hiiiiisssss worrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrk!!"

More toe tappingâ€¦

Again: "Iiiiiinnnnn hiiiiisssss worrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrk!!"

Jeff joined in from the next cube over: "Eeeeeee-oooohhhhhhhhhhh!"

Awesome, more finger-drumming.

Then I remembered that I had dialed into a conference call about 10 minutes previously which was about to start. I checked to make sure I was muted.

I wasn't muted.
