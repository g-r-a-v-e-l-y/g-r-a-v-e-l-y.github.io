An eight year old picture I took as part of a portfolio review requirement for UMBC. It's the bell tower in Baker Park in Frederick, MD.

I had no idea what I was doing. My dad's Nikon happened to have film in it and happened to have been dialed in to shoot in the conditions, I just attempted to focus and push the shutter. I wonder if I could acheive this affect intentionally now. The composition is very rigid.
