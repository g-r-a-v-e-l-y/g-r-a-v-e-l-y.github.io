[Artscape](http://www.artscape.org/index.cfm) is this weekend in Bolton Hill.

I'm going to definitely make the Saturday 5PM J Roddy Walston and The Business show, then maybe try to get over to the DJ booth for [DJ Vadim](http://www.artscape.org/index.cfm?page=schedules&id=198), then back to the main stage for the [Old 97's](http://www.artscape.org/index.cfm?page=schedules&id=28)

Sunday Night, [Sam Bush](http://www.artscape.org/index.cfm?page=schedules&id=15) and [Burning Spear](http://www.artscape.org/index.cfm?page=schedules&id=12) are paying in the same timeslot.

It's about 5 miles from my house, we'll be driving I guess.
