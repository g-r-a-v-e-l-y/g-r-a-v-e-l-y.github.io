Echard Wheeler, the photographer we had at our wedding, has posted a [selection on his blog](http://echardwheeler.com/2007/05/14/amanda-grant/) if you'd like a quick peek. If you'd like to see a bunch more, or buy prints:

[Pictage](http://www.pictage.com/308689). The event key is 'Guitar Hero'.

What ended up on my camera during the week is both [here](/photos/set/72157600215776203) and [on flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/grantandamanda/sets/72157600215776203/).

Here's me with a bit of an Eric Clapton chin going on. I must have been playing Crossroads on Expert - I get into it.
