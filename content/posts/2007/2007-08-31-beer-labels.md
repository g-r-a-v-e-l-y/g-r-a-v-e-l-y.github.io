We went down [early January](http://www.flickr.com/photos/grantandamanda/sets/72157594467083207/) before [the wedding](http://www.grantandamanda.com/wedding/) to scope out the area and to meet with the folks at [Weeping Radish](http://www.weepingradish.com/). They just happened to not only be happy to provide us with kegs but also to print labels for a few custom cases.

I procrastinated on submitting the designs until two days before the wedding, leaving no time to fix the spelling error that made it to the final. I fixed that and put them on flickr.

The design is an improvement on my original design for the invitations:

And everyone thought it turned out pretty well on the bottles. I still have a Maibock left, the rest is all gone!

The printer helpfully color-matched the SURGEON GENERAL and other sidebar stuff for each label.
