	<p>October 20th at the Maryland Fairgrounds! </p>

	<p>The <a href="http://mdoctoberfest.com/">website isn&#8217;t ready</a>. </p>

	<p>In an age of wikipedia and craigslist and really successful <span class="caps">DIY</span>-with-a-<span class="caps">CMS</span> sites which teens throw together with professionally (and non-professionally) designed look and feel templates a-plenty; hiring an organization to &#8220;design&#8221; a website like that is an anachronism. Well, it should be. </p>

	<p>They should have focused on the content, worked up a sitemap, and pointed to hosting, a <span class="caps">CMS</span>, and good partnersâ€”the &#8220;web design firm&#8221; that is, not the folks running the festival as they obviously have other specialties. A wordpress blog with comments disabled and five or seven static pages on the same .com would be cake to set up. Throw the logo at the top, push the pictures to a flickr set, add google maps integration for the directions page, link to all the vendors and sponsors everywhere possible, spam it to local communities looking for volunteers and then refine, refine, refine. A myspace or facebook page would have been sufficient even. </p>

	<p>Rant, rant, rant. </p>

	<p>All that said, I&#8217;m thinking about volunteering to help at the event, if they are taking any. </p>
