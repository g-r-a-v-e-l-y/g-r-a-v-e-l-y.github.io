I knew I wasn't the only person to [dig the new coke can](http://consumerist.com/consumer/pop-culture/the-new-coke-can-design-is-the-old-coke-can-design-but-better-276482.php):

I had a can collection in middle-school that got tossed in a move due to poor packing choice: I put them all in a large lawn bag instead of boxes. Guess what the movers thought. Into the trash went cans of coke, new coke, coke II (remember the roman numeral design?), coke classic, old pepsi logo and old diet pepsi logo cans, crystal pepsi cans and bottles, old mt. dew and mellow yellow logo cans, redskin bottles and cans of coke, and more I'm probably not remembering.
