From:

We have a lot of practice, all in the last five years and not counting helping friends move:

  * Moving to Columbia
  * [Moving Ben in from Ohio to MD](/new-roomy)
  * [Moving within Columbia](/comcast-billing-consultant)
  * [Moving to DC](/moving-in-four-days)
  * [Moving within DC](/moving-for-06)
  * [Moving to Towson](/moving-to-towson)
  * [And in a week, moving into a house we bought](/buying-a-house)

The big move is happening Saturday, starting early.

We have rented a truck that is about half the length of a full 18-wheeler, and because of the size only comes in a manual transmission.
