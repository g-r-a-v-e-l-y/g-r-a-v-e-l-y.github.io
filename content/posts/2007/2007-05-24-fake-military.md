From [Emergent Chaos](http://www.emergentchaos.com/archives/2007/05/billions_for_fashion_poli.html): the TSA behavior detection team had the state boys in Florida [lock up a gentleman in an irregular](http://www.tsa.gov/press/happenings/florida_uniform.shtm) army uniform. The acronym for this magic (you knew it was coming) is "Screening of Passengers by Observation Techniques (SPOT)".

A little over ten years ago, I was SPOTed by a Marine recruiter in the high school cafeteria. I was wearing my dad's old USMC short sleeve dress shirt with sergeant stripes on the sleeves and a Led Zeppelin t-shirt under it. The recruiter headed directly for me, so that he could let me know that I outranked him. He also told me that it was illegal to wear the uniform with the stripes still on it, and was I aware of the many exciting things the United States Marine Corps could do for me.

He didn't seem to mind that I wasn't really in Led Zeppelin.
