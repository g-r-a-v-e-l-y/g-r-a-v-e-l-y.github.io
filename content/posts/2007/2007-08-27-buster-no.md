Amanda wants a puppy in a few years. As much as I yell at my cat when he jumps on her cats with claws out, biting for their necks, it is nothing compared to the amount of yelling "NO!" it takes to poorly train a dog. I don't know if I'm up to the challenge yet.

They can be pretty damned cute though. That's my Mom and Bill's dog Buster. His name is actually Buster-no! I think, and they call him Buster for short.
