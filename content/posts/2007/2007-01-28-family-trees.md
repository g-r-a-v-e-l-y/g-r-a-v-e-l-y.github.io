A family history of the Italian side of my Mom's family was assembled in the 1970's. Aunts and Great Aunts of mine got copies of it at some time between now and then and fleshed out their generations. My mom made me full copy and gave it to me in a 2" three ring binder last weekend.

It would be neat even if I wasn't related to these folks, and that I am doesn't define me in any way. I'm not Italian.

That out of the way; I hope to digitize this collection and somehow get access to the original photos that are still accessible as I'm looking at what has to be sixth generation photocopied prints and typed copy. That the text of the history is typed dates it.

Gist: Relatives of mine took passage from from [Mariscovetere](http://www.valledellagri.net/holiday_italy/marsicovetere/map_marsicovetere_italy.htm), a village in southern Italy. In the history it is written "Marisco Vetere", likely an error. They landed in New York and then immediately traveled to stay with another Italian family in Washington, D.C. - the Oriani's. They lived at 205 B. St. NW according to the 1870 city directory. The Oriani's has just moved down from Baltimore and were also originally from Mariscovette.

Neat. Look at this modern map of DC and try to figure out where that would have been:

Notice how 1st street is directly in front of the Capitol building, then the map shows 395. 395 is underground here. Next over is 3rd street. I would have to guess B St. would be about where Constitution Avenue is, putty them just north of the top 395 shield on the map.

Future posts: My Great Great Great Grandmother's Will, my Great Great Grandfathers official record on file as a Washington D.C Police Officer, how in the late 1800's they ran the concessions at the National Theatre, rented houses near the above described area to congressmen, making bathtub booze, Baltimore connections to Little Italy, and of course, pictures!
