I’m enjoying the first track of [_In Rainbows_](http://www.inrainbows.com/), _Mk 1_, and it has a nice callback to the first disc over a gradual fade-in. _Down Is The New Up_ has a nice start, and what could be more refreshing than a normal drum kit played by a human? It sounds great! The song builds and builds, string and piano interaction backing Thom nicely. The beat changes from a slow hip hop roll to kicks and snares together at the 3:03 mark and the strings and piano begin echoing with urgency. A crescendo is approaching as we approach 3:30 into the tune.

At that point precisely, the guitars and bass completely fail even enter the track.

Damnit.

**Update**: It’s been a month, I love both releases and wouldn’t change a thing now.
