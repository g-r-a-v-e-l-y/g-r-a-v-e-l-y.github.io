It isn't very often that I stray from technical reference books and SF short stories and novels. I grabbed [A Confederacy of Dunces](http://www.amazon.com/Confederacy-Dunces-John-Kennedy-Toole/dp/0517122707/sr=8-3/qid=1169129091/ref=pd_bbs_3/104-6710242-9348761?ie=UTF8&s=books) after it came up in the a book forum I read and was universally praised.

At about 60 pages in, I'm starting to agree.

As for the usual faire, I've also gone through these in the past few months:
