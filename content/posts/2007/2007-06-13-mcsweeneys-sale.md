Checking out McSweeney's was on my some-day-maybe list for a few years, and I finally got around to buying [The Better of McSweeney's, Volume 1](http://www.amazon.com/Better-McSweeneys-1-Dave-Eggers/dp/1932416331/ref=pd_bbs_sr_7/105-2829745-1113229?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1181744937&sr=8-7) in BWI airport this winter. Great stuff.

I've since grabbed [Created in Darkness by Troubled Americans: The Best of McSweeney's Humor Category](http://www.amazon.com/Created-Darkness-Troubled-Americans-McSweeneys/dp/1400076854/ref=sr_1_13/105-2829745-1113229?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1181744937&sr=8-13) and enjoyed it over two weeks at the beach for my weddinig and honeymoon.

> As you may know, it's been tough going for many independent publishers, McSweeney's included, since our distributor filed for bankruptcy last December 29. We lost about $130,000â€”actual earnings that were simply erased. Due to the intricacies of the settlement, the real hurt didn't hit right away, but it's hitting now. Like most small publishers, our business is basically a break-even proposition in the best of times, so there's really no way to absorb a loss that big.
>
> We are committed to getting through and past this difficult time, and we're hoping you, the readers, who have from the start made McSweeney's possible, will help us.
>
> Over the next week or so, we'll be holding an [inventory sell-off](http://store.mcsweeneys.net/) and [rare-item auction](http://search.ebay.com/_W0QQsassZtimothymcsweeneysQQhtZ-1), which we hope will make a dent in the losses we sustained. A few years ago, the indispensable comics publisher Fantagraphics, in similarly dire straits, held a similar sale, and it helped them greatly. We're hoping to do the same.
>
> So if you've had your eye on anything we've produced, now would be a great time to take the plunge. For the next week or so, [subscriptions are $5 off, new books are 30 percent off, and the entire backlist is 50 percent off](http://store.mcsweeneys.net/). Please check out the [store](http://store.mcsweeneys.net/) and enjoy the astounding savings, while knowing every purchase will help dig us out of a big hole.

OK, it's only $5 off a regular four-book subscription, but that's $12.50 a book, and each one is bound to be great.

Bound.
