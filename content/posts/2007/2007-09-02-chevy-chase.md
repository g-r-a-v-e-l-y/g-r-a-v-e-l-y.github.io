> Chase did not enter [medical school](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_school); instead he played [drums](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drums) for a time with the college band The Leather Canary, headed by school chums [Walter Becker](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Becker) and [Donald Fagen](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Fagen). At the time, Chase called the group "a bad [jazz](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz) band," but Becker and Fagen went on to success after they changed their band's name to [Steely Dan](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steely_Dan)....
