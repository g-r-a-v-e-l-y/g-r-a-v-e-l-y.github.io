	<p><a href="http://www.arstechnica.com/">Arsr Technica</a> published an <a href="http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/the-pseudoscience-behind-homeopathy.ars">excellent survey on homeopathy</a>; an explantion of the madness and smattering of current inter-field debates. </p>

	<p>I know, I know, cue anecdotal evidence of an old-world cure that worked for your uncle&#8217;s brother&#8217;s kid, <a href="/but-you-never-know">who are these &#8216;scientists&#8217; trying to deny third-hand direct experience</a>!? </p>

	<p>Luckily this sort of foolishness is relegated to medicine and doens&#8217;t creep into politics or ethics. Phew. </p>
