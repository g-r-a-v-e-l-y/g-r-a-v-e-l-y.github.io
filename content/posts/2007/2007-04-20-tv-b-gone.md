Some folks were playing with a [TV-B-Gone](http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2007/04/how_to_double_the_range_o.html) at the [Shmoocon](http://www.shmoocon.com/) after-party at Adams Mill.

Why do people think [this shit](http://www.turnoffyourtv.com/) is clever? I reached past them and turned the ~~basketball game~~ commercials back on.

Because I'm a tool of the system oppressing the individual and dumbing down the populace, obviously. Or something.
