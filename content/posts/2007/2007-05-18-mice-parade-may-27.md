Would anyone be interested in a [Sunday night show in DC](http://www.last.fm/event/155143)? Would Pizza Paradiso in Georgetown be a good enough bribe? I caught this on [my last.fm recommended events RSS](http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/1.0/user/writequit/eventsysrecs.rss).

I've never been to the venue.

Expect a post rock act and two folk artists. Also expect a relatively late evening for a Sunday, as the shows start at 9. Check the first last.fm link for audio of each or Mice Parade's [myspace](http://www.myspace.com/miceparade22), if you do that sort of thing.

**Update**: This is the day before we all have off work for Memorial day, you no longer have any excuses. How many tickets do I need to buy?
