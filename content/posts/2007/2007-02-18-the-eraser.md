Hardware failure took the site offline for a while. I'm hosting from my powerbook for now until we put the new server in place.

Thom Yorke's _The Eraser_ is great for noodling along to for guitarists of limited ability.

I should really get the wedding website working again.

The day the server failed was the day my boss's boss's boss sent out the formal welcome to the company e-mail ghostwritten by my boss, including a link to the site. Nice.
