Textpattern is pretty rad and Wordpress seems to be large target for malware,
so I have abandonded ship.

That means I'll lose some of the music sidebar trickery, so I logged into the
last.fm account I thought I'd never use. They've developed into having a
pretty nice flickr-ish API that should work nicely.

Jokerbone is a pretty large site, blogs considered. Textpattern blew up trying
to import so that will be the next focus.
