I'd long forgotten this trilogy which I probably read in the late 80's, until it was mentioned on a book forum I frequent:

[John Christopher's Tripods Trilogy](http://www.amazon.com/Tripods-Trilogy-John-Christopher/dp/0020425716/sr=8-1/qid=1172634787/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-4624407-1586246?ie=UTF8&s=books)

[Nerdy](http://www.gnelson.demon.co.uk/tripage/trilogy.html).

Those are definitely the editions I got from the library when I read them.

I long associated <strike>a song which is on the tip of my tongue with the desolation of society portrayed in the novels, and that association hung with me long after I'd forgotten the novels themselves as a collection of imagery and a vague connection to war of the worlds.

I think it was a Peter Gabriel tune, not sure. Will update when I remember.</strike>

... [The End of the Innocence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_the_Innocence_%28song%29) with the trilogy, probably because it was on when I was reading it in the back of the car on the way to the grocery store or something cool like that.

The only title that stuck with me (and I was devouring teen and adult SF back then) was [Green Futures of Tycho](http://www.amazon.com/Green-Futures-Tycho-Starscape/dp/0765352389/sr=1-1/qid=1172635308/ref=sr_1_1/103-4624407-1586246?ie=UTF8&s=books).
