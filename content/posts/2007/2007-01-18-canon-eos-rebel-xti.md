The [Sony F717](/sony-dsc-f717-my-new-toy.html) I've enjoyed for the past four years has been great to me. My only lingering gripe with the camera has been how slow it is between and leading up to each picture. As a combination 27th birthday present / present to myself for going full time at the new job, I upgraded.

I've only been able to use it nights after getting home from work this week - I've played with it in the living room grabbing shots of cats and guitars. I've been using the Sony as an overkill point-and-shoot for so long, it will be interesting adapting to holding the camera to my eye and not having a live preview of the exposure's affect in the LCD.

I also got at 2GB CF card for the Canon because I used to have to take my laptop to family parties and trips so that I could dump the Sony to it two or three times as it filled up.

The Canon is an excellent compact DSLR that takes all of the auto-focus Canon lenses, flash and battery adaptors. Exciting. As I've always said, the only thing between me and world renown artistic penetration in all segments of society is a cooler camera. I'll have to think of a new excuse.

Amanda: Where is the zoom?
Me: I don't have that a lens for that.
Amanda: How do I get closer?
Me: Get closer. :confused:

Amanda: I don't like it. It's fast but I don't like it.
