Ken and Erica had an old Kenwood combo amplifier to get rid of, I had a a home theater system powering my living room audio kitchen audio and and the TV powering the TV audio.

Great upgrade, Amanda thinks it is ugly.

Old 2004 Onkyo:


New 1973 Kenwood:


The Kenwood also has a Phono input, which will be great with the old Dual record player my dad gave me. I need to get some DeOxit to clean up all the pots and connections and it'll be perfect.

I'm going to move the home theater amp to the basement to go with the old PolkAudio loudspeakers my Uncle Tim gave me, pics when it gets set up.

We also had new deadbolts put on the front and rear doors, my step-father Bill happens to lock-smith. It was neat to watch, here he is picking out tumblers so that the keys match:

We also pulled up the carpet in the middle-upstairs bedroom.

The hallway pine floor looks like this:

Under the carpet we found completely unfinished pine:


We can't decide what we want to do with it as this room is around the bottom our list of priorities and pulling up the carpet was just an itch I wanted to scratch since doing it was free and relatively easy.
