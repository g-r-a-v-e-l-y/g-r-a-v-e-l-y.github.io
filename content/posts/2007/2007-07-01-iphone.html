<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: yeah<br />
<span class="imgreen">Grant</span>: haha<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: oops<br />
&raquo; once you touch it, you just can&#8217;t stop<br />
<span class="imgreen">Grant</span>: haha<br />
&raquo; so you like it?<br />
&raquo; typing with your thumbs or one finger?<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: back and forth<br />
&raquo; still not that good with it<br />
&raquo; bb keyboard is better<br />
<span class="imgreen">Grant</span>: interesting<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: the ui is fantastic<br />
<span class="imgreen">Grant</span>: hehe<br />
&raquo; awesome<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: mail sucks<br />
&raquo; it looks just like mail.app, but lacks the awesome sauce<br />
&raquo; (smart folders, rules, etc.)<br />
<span class="imgreen">Grant</span>: are you walking around in public with it out all the time like a segway owner &#8220;look at me and look what I have!&#8221; while wearing a cheesy black helmet, polo shirt tucked into khakis?<br />
&raquo; because I totally would if I had one<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>:lol<br />
&raquo; no<br />
&raquo; I still use it with my bt headset<br />
<span class="imgreen">Grant</span>: hehe<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: lack of a clipboard sucks<br />
<span class="imgreen">Grant</span>: wtf<br />
&raquo; my blackberry has a clipboard<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: shhhh<br />
&raquo; we know, we know ;)<br />
&raquo; the physics engine rocks<br />
&raquo; (scrolling, etc).  I&#8217;d love to have it in os x<br />
<span class="imgreen">Grant</span>: does it have crates you can shoot?<br />
<span class="imblue">Sasha</span>: yes<br />
<span class="imgreen">Grant</span>: holy shit I&#8217;m buying one</p>
