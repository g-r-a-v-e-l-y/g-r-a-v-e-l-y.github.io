	<p>Some friend&#8217;s-of-a-friend have worked very hard in the east coast music scene to put together a social networking and music sales site with a really <a href="http://www.unsungherorevolution.com/events.php">kick-ass core concept</a>.</p>

	<p>If you are in a band and using myspace to promote, you should check it out: <a href="http://www.uhrev.com/">http://www.uhrev.com/</a></p>

	<p><img alt="" src="/images/astroturf.gif" alt="astroturf" /></p>

	<p>The concept seems a little strange. </p>

	<p>Sell your tracks there and keep 75% of the sales price. The remaining 25% goes to the site.</p>

	<p>If your fans want to sell your tracks, you get 50% of the sales price and the fan gets 25%. The remaining 25% goes to the site. </p>

	<p>Fans get to promote their favorite bands and get a cut, knowing the band will still get more than if they sold the same tracks on itunes or amazon. </p>

	<p>There is no <span class="caps">DRM</span>. </p>
