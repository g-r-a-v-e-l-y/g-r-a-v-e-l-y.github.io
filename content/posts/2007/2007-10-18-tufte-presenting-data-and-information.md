I had the pleasure of attending a one day course on the [presentation of data and information](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/courses) given by [Edward Tufte](http://www.tufte.com) in Washington DC.

I already owned copies of [_The Visual Display of Quantitative Information_](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi), as well as [_Envisioning Information_](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_ei), but with the course came bundled four of his books; the two above, as well as [_Visual Explanations_](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_visex), and his newest work, [_Beautiful Evidence_](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_visex).

I thoroughly enjoyed it and actually took notes!

In addition to the general theme of data presentation, Tuft spoke to his personal interests in science, the history of data presentation, and philosophy.
