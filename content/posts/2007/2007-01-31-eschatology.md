A bumper sticker seen in traffic:


> **_WARNING_**: In case of **_RAPTURE_** this car will be unmanned!

Me: Ha. In-case-of-rapture-this-car-will-be-unmanned. Nice.
Her: What?
Me: The bumper sticker on that car.
Her: What's that mean?

Her: Maybe it's a Jurassic Park reference?
Me: What?

**Him**: It says [rapture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapture), not [raptor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velociraptor).
Me: In case of raptor, stay the fuck in the car!
Her: Shut up! I didn't know!

**Him**: I hear they hunt in packs!
Her: Ha!
Me: Oh look at that empty car! I wonder if they were eaten by dinosaurs!
**Him**: In case of rapture, hide in the kitchen cabinets!

Et cetera, to wit's endâ€¦
