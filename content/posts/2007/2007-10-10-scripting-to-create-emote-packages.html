perl is fun. I threw together a script this evening that will leech all the
gif's from a web directory and generate emoticon packages. My test subject was
[Will's](http://secret.cc/) collection of abandoned emoticons. Oh and the new
Radiohead album is out and served as excellent background music.

**Packs**
[Adium](/files/sa/misc_emotes.AdiumEmoticonSet.zip)

[Pidgin](/files/sa/misc_emotes.tar.gz)

The script is terrible! I'll probably never get around to cleaning it up, but
when I do, I'll update this post. Whenever that happens, I'll GPL it.
