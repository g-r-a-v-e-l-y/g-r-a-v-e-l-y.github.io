<p>As a housewarming present, Sasha and his grandmother gave Amanda and I two wonderful paintings that she painted. I finally took a few pictures while doing house stuff this weekend. They look great in the kitchen over the sink and by the back door.</p>


<p>I took a few detail photos. </p>

<p>I really dig the depth of the paint. She has tons of larger works for sale.</p>
