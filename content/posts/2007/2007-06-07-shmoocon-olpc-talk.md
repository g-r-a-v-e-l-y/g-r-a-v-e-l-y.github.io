This has been available for a while but I forgot to link to it: The [Shmoocon talks](http://www.shmoocon.org/2007/videos/OLPC%20Panel%20An%20Examination%20of%20OLPC%20Security%20and%20the%20Impact%20on%20Society%20-%20Sean%20Coyne,%20Ivan%20Krstic,%20Jason%20Scott,%20Scott%20Roberts.mp4) on the [One Laptop per Child](http://laptop.org/en/vision/index.shtml) project. The discussion has a bit of an information security leaning to it given the audience, but it still packs content for people that don't approach everything with a screwdriver and a tinfoil hat.

It was neat watching the otherwise brilliant [Dan Kaminsky](http://www.doxpara.com/) seemingly miss the point during the Q&A.;

Since I just poked at the guy, I should link to his talk too: [Weaponizing Noam Chomsky, or Hacking with Pattern Languages](http://www.shmoocon.org/2007/videos/Weaponizing%20Noam%20Chomsky,%20or%20Hacking%20with%20Pattern%20Languages%20-%20Dan%20Kaminsky.mp4), which I think was really really interesting, [if slagged](http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2007/03/shmoocon-2007-wrap-up.html) by professional pedant Toby Kohlenberg.

I don't have anything to make up for poking Toby, so I'll probably end up being interviewd by him for a job or something similar.
