	<p>Will & Nat got a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puggle_%28dog%29">puggle</a>.<br />
<blockquote><span class="imgreen">Will</span>: Your nephew weighs 8 pounds on the dot<br />
<span class="imgreen">Will</span>: He doesnt have worms either<br />
&raquo; woohoo!<br />
<span class="imblue">Grant</span>: The name is still Jake right?<br />
<span class="imgreen">Will</span>: Petey<br />
<span class="imblue">Grant</span>: So peteyandjake?<br />
<span class="imgreen">Will</span>: yep<br />
<span class="imblue">Grant</span>: <a href="http://www.grantstavely.com/kitten-names#c001554">I hate you</a>.<br />
</blockquote></p>

	<p>You can&#8217;t argue much with cute:</p>

	<p><strong>Update</strong>:<br />
<blockquote><span class="imgreen">Will</span>: so my boy<br />
<span class="imgreen">Will</span>: he comes in the back door after hanging out with me and grilling some chicken<br />
&raquo; so he <span class="caps">TEARS</span> into the front of the house<br />
&raquo; like full on sprint from the back door<br />
&raquo; and slams head first into the glass door in the front<br />
&raquo; big thud<br />
<span class="imblue">Grant</span>: hahahahahahahah<br />
<span class="imgreen">Will</span>: stumbles back a few steps, shakes his head, brushes his snout with his paw, then stumbles upstairs<br />
&raquo; it was hilarious and sad all at once<br />
<span class="imblue">Grant</span>: puggles not a smart breed eh?<br />
<span class="imgreen">Will</span>: either that or nat just cleaned the glass door<br />
&raquo; haha<br />
</blockquote><br />
...and from my spies&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><span class="imgreen">Will</span>: so after that, he comes upstairs
&raquo; tries to jump on the couch
&raquo; bounces off the front part of the cushion, falls back, bangs his head on the coffee table
&raquo; he is like crash test dummy dog
