Amanda and I are buying a house. We will be moving in on the last weekend in
June.

[707 South Linwood](http://picasaweb.google.com/HelpShop.com/707SouthLinwoodAveForSale).

All of our bookshelves are already boxed. We are not taking much or any of our furniture, so if you'd like any, come and get it. After moving every year for the past seven years, we could not be more excited.

Like, five-years-old-waiting-for-christmas-morning excited. Wow.
