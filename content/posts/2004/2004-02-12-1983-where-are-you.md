Lucas is putting out the _Special Edition_ Star Wars flicks on DVD. Finally -- when it can make him the maximum amount of money.

Keeping the your-mom joke lively -- my mom and I went to see [Episode IV](http://www.originaltrilogy.com/) when it was first re-released as a Special Edition on the big screen. Neither of us were impressed.

[Greedo](http://www.viewaskew.com/newboard/messages301/2367.html) shot first. The only character we can all dig gets castrated him before they even left Tatooine.

Terrible.
