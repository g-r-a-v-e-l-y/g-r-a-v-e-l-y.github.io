[Mike Newdow](http://www.restorethepledge.com/) is suing to get the "under god" bit removed from the _official_ version of the Pledge we all got to recite in school every morning.

It made for an interesting [c-span](http://www.c-span.org)-commute. To hear him debate, go to c-span.org and search for "newdow". Come back and state your mind.
