Went and saw the [band](http://outerloop.tv/) Aaron managed to sneak himself into over the weekend.

  1. The venue was a bar in my home town which I didn't even know still existed (the bar, not the town). I used to ride my bike there to try to sneak in and pump quarters into the cigarette vending machine - the bartender was generally quick enough to chase us out.

  2. The neighborhood "big kid" from elementary school who I haven't really seen in 10 years was working the door. I'm 5" taller than him. He let us in without paying full cover as we lacked the cash so all is forgiven even though he ripped our tree fort down.

  3. I've always thought that bands that cover any Hendrix song from "The Ultimate Experience" should have their guitars taken away but I'm cool if it's played with the band's style, which it was. Cheers to that.

  4. Yes, they do run to the dance floor if you cover a Skynard song in some places. Seriously.

  5. Tip your waitresses and bartenders please.
