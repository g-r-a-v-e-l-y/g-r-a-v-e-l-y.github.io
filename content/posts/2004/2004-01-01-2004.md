Welcome to 2004.

Coincidentally I'm watching _Groundhog Day_ on Encore this 1/1, among the Lebowski's and the Office Space's to which Ben and I pre-call most of the good lines. Bing!

"does he have to use the word poopy?"

John's party was nice. 2003 was nice. I'd love to do the beginning over again so that I could have a cigarette. Lots of cigarettes. So many. mmmmmmmm.

Anyway, back to the movie..
