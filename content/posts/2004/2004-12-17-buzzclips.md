I use and recommend purchasing as I did [Acquisistion](http://www.acquisitionx.com/) for the mac. When Acquisition gets a new song, it adds the song to an "Acquisition" playlist in iTunes, making the new stuff super easy to filter, tag, and check out.

Thanks to this week's randomness, I'm ear-surfing to a mix of Danny Gatton live, Bonobo, Pink Floyd's "The Committee" soundtrack, Husker Du, Hexstatic, DJ Krush, They Might Be Giants, Velvet Revolver, and Greyboy.

This is a PSA and everyone is supposed to reply with "oh you should check these guys out" type comments. Backup plan: get "The Committee", it makes for great spoken word stuff between _anything_. Quoth the random snippet I was able to retrieve from Internets about the film:


> THE COMMITTEE (1968)
>
> Directed by Peter Sykes.
Produced by Max Steuer.
Pink Floyd produced the music to the film. It was originally Syd Barrett who was suppossed to make the score, but his work was not finished.The soundtrack has not been released.
>
> The film is short and probably a bit strange. The cast: Jimmy Gardner, Paul Jones, Tom Kempinski, Robert Langdon Lloyd and Pauline Munro.

The clips sound like eery late 60's SF sound effects backgrounding dialog that is absolutely the bee-knee's.

Paul-when-listening-to-random-tune-on-his-PC: Ah, this must be from Grant. You can tell it's a Grant song when there are random bits with people talking and shit over the music.

Oh, and since starting this post I've switched to just [Simon Green, er, Bonobo](http://www.ninjatune.net/ninja/artist.php?id=38). Dig.
