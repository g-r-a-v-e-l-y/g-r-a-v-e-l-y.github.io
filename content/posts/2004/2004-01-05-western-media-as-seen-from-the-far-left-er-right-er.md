[Packetstorm](http://packetstormsecurity.nl/) happened to link [Aljazeera](http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/E78B0D76-6711-4CB1-979D-80D5499358B6.htm) and I couldn't help but [follow it](/000383.php#000372).

It's always nice to see a local [make good](/000496.php). In this case, [DC's own](http://www.msnbc.com/onair/bios/k_couric.asp) (well at least I remember it) Couric.

[This is good right](http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/E78B0D76-6711-4CB1-979D-80D5499358B6.htm)?
