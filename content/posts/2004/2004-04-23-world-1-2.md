Maybe the riffs aren't as similar as my brain wanted them to be this morning but the bass/synth line from the [Weather Report](http://www.jacopastorius.com/music/essential/wr_mrgone.asp) song _[River People_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000027EW/qid=1082725990/sr=8-4/ref=sr_8_4/104-3859357-8679106?v=glance&s=music&n=507846) just might be the influence for the music to world 1-2. Just might.
