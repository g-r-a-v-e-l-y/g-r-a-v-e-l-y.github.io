Jokerbone archives go back to 2002.

I have "posts" on a "homepage" going back to [July of '99](/www/beginnings/index2.html). Does that count? Have I been "blogging since 1999"? Supposing I had, is that a point of pride or shame? For those of you that followed the link, I know, I know, it sucks.

I imported my old hand written php blog into MT. Should I import those five posts or so, plus others I have archived from various sites between that one and jokerbone.com into the MT system?
