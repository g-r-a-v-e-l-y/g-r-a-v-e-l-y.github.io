After driving past their headquarters visible from NY Ave, NW on the way to and from the B/W Parkway with the knowledge that the 3+ hours a day in my car could be better spent, I've finally broken down and gotten an XM Radio receiver. This is 6 days after the first time I saw one outside of a store, so I guess I didn't wait _too_ long.

I'm very impressed. I have no idea where I'm going to mount the unit on my dash in my RSX but I'm not really worries yet.

When I figure that out, there will be pictures.
