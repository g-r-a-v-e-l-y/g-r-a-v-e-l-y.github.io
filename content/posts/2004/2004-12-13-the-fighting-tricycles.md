Got this from my old roomate Phil:

> This Saturday, the 18th, The Fighting Tricycles (billy, steve, phil, richard) are opening for New York Indie Rock Icons, '[The Wrens](http://www.wrens.com/)' at the [Talking Head](http://www.talkingheadclub.com). If you haven't checked these fellas out, they're something. (Or as Robert Tilton might say, "Aren't they something?")

We'll have a new demo with a few tunes, some live footage, and all of our ATM passwords.

Show's 12 bucks but if you came specifically for us we'll be sure to throw you a free CD, and with the ATM password you can easily recoup the losses.

So, happy holidays and hope to see ya there or anywhere else for that matter.

Phil

I will be <strike>sauced</strike> occupied at the office Christmas party and can't attend.
