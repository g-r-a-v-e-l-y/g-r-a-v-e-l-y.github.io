The worst seems to have been from 2 to 6 this morning. [jamesbrown]Got a cold sweat!![/jamesbrown]. Ibuprofen and work today. Excelllent.

UPDATE: Well that sucked. I took off sick tomorrow, which as a consultant means I get to hold to my prior engagements from home and take phone support calls in bed. Damn phones.
