Thread over to [etymology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thursday).

I seem to recall being taught Greek and Roman myths in grade school with no mention of the Norse counterparts.

I've erased a few sentances concerning why this may be (American puritanical roots, 20th century Christian dominance in our society, and more) but really all I am qualified to say is _wtf_?

Alternatively, the concept of "I've erased foo because I can't think of how to communicate bar!" is so very tastily electronic isn't it? If this were a letter that I'd pencil'd to you and was full of erasure marks, would you think me a thoughtful person?
