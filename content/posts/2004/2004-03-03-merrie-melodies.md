> **Ring Colors And Their Significance**

> Since 1936, when the concentric circles (called "rings" for convenience) opening was introduced on Merrie Melodies, the first color used was blue because of the advent of blue hues in the new 3-color Technicolor process opened up to Disney's competitors that year. I Wanna Play House was the first Merrie Melodies with rings, while a later film (not known due to Blue Ribbon reissue policy) introduced the zooming WB shield (a device borrowed from WB's live-action films) used on virtually every WB cartoon hence.
