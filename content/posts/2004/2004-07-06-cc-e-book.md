Mail it to someone else and ask them to read it allowed to you over the phone. Use the text-to-speach engine on your PC to make have it read back to you by a text-to-speach-engine. Put it on a PDA. Use cat, less, mail, and wait in a cron job and have it SMS'd to your mobile phone line by line. Print it.
