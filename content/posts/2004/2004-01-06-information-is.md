Twice in the past month, she's corrected me when giving my phone number to people standing behind cash registers -- once at blockbuster and once at a shoe store. It has been long enough now that I can blog about it without sounding like I'm whining about being corrected -- honest mistake.

I hadn't forgotten my own phone number. I always make one up. I generally use old phone numbers mixed up. I do the same with my address unless I'm getting something delivered or credit card validation has failed once and I'm specifically told that the bogus addrses is the cause. I make up e-mail addresses@jokerbone.com because I can and when I know it's junk anyway give out addresses@[electricfork.com](http://www.electricfork.com/).

I like to think that I've polluted the information stream about myself enough that it is becoming [white noise](http://www.howstuffworks.com/question47.htm).
