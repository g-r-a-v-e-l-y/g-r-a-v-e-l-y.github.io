I just signed up for [Shmoocon](http://www.shmoocon.org/about.html), billing itself as:

> an all-new, annual East coast hacker convention hell-bent on offering an interesting and new atmosphere for demonstrating technology exploitation, inventive software & hardware solutions, as well as open discussion of critical information security issues.

I hope I get a t-shirt.
