Ah to be able to rant so wellâ€¦

[mjr argues security concepts on the firewall-wizards mailing list](http://honor.trusecure.com/pipermail/firewall-wizards/2004-June/016661.html).

> Join me in challenging the preconceptions of an industry that has grown up around "if you can't do something RIGHT do something STUPID, HARDER!"
>
> That's what we're talking about, here, with all the focus on patch management:
>  - Rather than run a good O/S: run a bad one and MANAGE it BETTER
>  - Rather than understand your connectivity: leave it OPEN and FIDDLE WITH your endpoints CONSTANTLY
>  - Rather than run good code: run bad code and UPGRADE IT DAILY

Yes, the vendors (antivirus / security / firewall / software / hardware) seem to have no problem with it eh?
