![Ooooohh, a gradient!](/images/spy_goo_thumb.gif)There is a [new google design](http://www.squarefree.com/archives/000369.html) traversing the blogosphere.

It is a slight change in the existing design, which is like adding a small fraction to zero and then rounding down. I like it.

The cookie sticks around once you hit it - my [browser](http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb/5/beta/) has been hitting it for the past week or so and I've just now noticed it enough times to blog it.
