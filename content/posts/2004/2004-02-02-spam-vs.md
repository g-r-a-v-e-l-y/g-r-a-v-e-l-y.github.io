I am the anti-spam guy. I know where it comes from, what it looks like, who is sending it, and why. I sell this knowledge to clients by setting up front-end servers running [the shizzle](http://www.debian.org/) open source OS which in turn run [the bomb](http://www.exim.org/) mail transport agents and the absolute efffing [wickety whack](http://www.spamassassin.org) spam filtering software.

I charge for the installation voodoo. The software exists due to the work of [others](/000510.php) but the wetware exists because for every 100 people, a few will be complete assholes.

I am refering to the senders of spam. Assholes. Every one of them.

People with "solutions" to the spam problem are like [integrations](http://calculus.org/) of assholes. They are asshole-primes. [Read more here](http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=95250&cid=8164148) for a quick test you can use to demonstrate that they have indeed failed to succeed where religion, drugs, etc have failed to succeed over and over solving the whole "why is there evil" problem.
