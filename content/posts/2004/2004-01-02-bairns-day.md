I was just surfing [Modern Drunkard Magazine](http://www.moderndrunkardmagazine.com/issues/09_03/09-03-reasons-to-get-drunk-dec.htm) as linked from [Kottke](http://www.kottke.org/index.html) and couldn't help but note that my own birthday (12/28) is listed as the unluckiest day of the year.

Further [research](http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/9800/december.html) tells meâ€¦

> This day commomerates Herold's slaugher of infant boys under the age of two.
