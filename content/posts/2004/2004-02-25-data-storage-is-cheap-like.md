Great [/.](http://www.slashdot.org/) thread covering [Anheuser-Busch](http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/ptech/02/25/bus2.feat.beer.network/index.html)'s distribution model. Best [comment](http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=98205&cid=8387946) evar:

> Why the very thought of anyone drinking such a low class beverage has CAUSED MY MONOCLE TO POP RIGHT OUT! And really, who drinks beer in this day and age anyway? Everyone should drink only expensive wine and scotch.

> Why just the other day my chauffer took a wrong turn off of the freeway and pulled me past this run down little liquor store where this shabby looking man (who by the way was driving a Pontiac! A PONTIAC!!!) who hadn't shaved for a couple of days was walking out with a bottle of Johnny Walker Red. RED LABEL?! I exclaimed, exhaling a puff of cigar smoke and tipping my top hat back in a bemused manner. WHO ARE THESE CRETINS? I practically had my driver phone the police right then and there.

AmberBoch ain't too shabby.
