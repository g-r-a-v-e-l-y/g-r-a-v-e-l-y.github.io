I'm not really digging the latest BB songs as much as the past three albums but thanks to a pretty heinous hangover and a complete ignorance of what channel is what here in DC, I found myself watching VH1 this morning and caught the _Check it out_ video.

I am most definitely going to have to get a Star Trek TOS uniform. I googled for a pic to place in this post and found this near the top of the list:

> Reviewer: Jeff Conrad - See all my reviews

> Just saw a beastie boys video today that reenacts the pon farr battle on a street corner.

The [rest of the episode reviews](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/6300213382/104-0035951-4876715?v=glance) are great too.
