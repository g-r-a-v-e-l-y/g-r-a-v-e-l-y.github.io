Just got back from a bi-weekly work meeting. XM on the way home bounced around from a Faces song on Deep Tracks (Rod Stewart, pre-suck), a Pat Methany song on Beyond Jazz (I gave it 2 minutes - no guitar, changed it), Beastie Boys on Ethel XL (whachoowant?), then danced over all of my presets before settling on a c-span [recording of todays House Ways and Means Committe](http://waysandmeans.house.gov/hearings.asp?formmode=detail&hearing=139).
