[Most impressive](http://www.tnt.tv/Title/Display/0,5918,456406,00.html).

I would have liked to see more on the Father Callahan given his roll [the series](http://www.stephenking.com/pages/Works/Dark_Tower_VI/). The novel was the story of an addict priest with a faith problem, the movie is a vampire thriller. Both are good.

The cinematic treatment I recall was heavily focused on the boy and the priest -- this longer format allows for an equal look at all of the major players. I'm two and a half hours into it right now and it's not half over. If you have the time, check it out.

UPDATE: Just finnished it. 4 hours of my Sunday and it was ruined in the last 10 minutes. Weak ending, Very weak. -- While I'm complaining, can we have a thriller movie that doesn't end with _Paint it Black_ or _Sympathy for the Devil_?
