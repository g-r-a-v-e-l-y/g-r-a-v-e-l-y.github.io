Amazingly I just managed to snatch up three tickets the day before the event. Thanks for the reminder Sean.

**UPDATE / GRIPE**: The ticketma$ter surcharge for three tickets cost more than an individual ticket.

Freshmeat project idea: Replace Ticketmaster with an open system.

**UPDATE TWO: I have an extra ticket! Erk! Brent! Anybody?**
