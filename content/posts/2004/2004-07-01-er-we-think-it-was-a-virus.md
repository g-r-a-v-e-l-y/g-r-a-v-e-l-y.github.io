Now that the scare is over:

Amanda woke up Tuesday morning around 4 with chest pains, left arm hurting, etc. Around 5 we decided to see try the emergency room. I left around 7:30 assuming she'd be released and home by mid-day.

I got home to find out that she was being transfered to Adventist in Tacoma Park after an overnight for a catheter procedure whereby a video camera looks at her heart from the inside to make sure everything is OK. Blood tests were showing elevated levels of cardio-enzymes; I'm told this indicates that the heart is under stressâ€¦ or something.

Lots of stress and unknowns later, she emerged from the procedure A-OK and is at my place, bed-ridden for the next 4 or 5 days. Do stop by if you have the time.

Those of you left in the dark -- no hard feelings, we didn't want to scare anyone but in hindsight probably would have spread the word a bit more.
