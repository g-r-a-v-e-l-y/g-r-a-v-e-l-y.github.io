Switching must be tough. I remember kicking and screaming a bit but now switch app's, os', etc all the time. I don't mean to imply that I'm Captain Open Minded.

[Formal testing](http://www.userinstinct.com/viewpost.php?postid=gnome26review&page=7) of a switcher to gnome 2.6 reveals how a lot of people I know would react when switching to gnome.

Don't tell anyone but they probably acted the same way the first 10 times they did the same tasks in the OS to which they are now accustomed.
