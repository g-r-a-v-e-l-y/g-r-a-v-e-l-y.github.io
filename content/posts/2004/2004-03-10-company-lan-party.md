The boss threw a lan party.

Yes, sitting like that with my tongue out improves my rail gun accuracy by 25%. Yes, that _is_ Guinness the boss provided.

Johnathan and I took first in the ctf tourney. I was a one game trick thanks to an extremely short attention span and my powerbook but everyone seemed to have a good time.

Will was impressive for a UT player. David had wicked aim. Ethan was uhm, there tooâ€¦ damned CS players.
