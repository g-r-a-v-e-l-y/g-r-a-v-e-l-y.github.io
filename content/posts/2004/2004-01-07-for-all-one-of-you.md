If you are running osX, you need [sofa](http://sofa.ouvaton.org/). On my powerbook, I need all the real estate I can get. I've temporarily sworn off virtual desktops / pagers in memory of running [enlightenment](http://www.enlightenment.org/) for two years and have actually gotten used to [Expose](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/expose/exposetheater.html); if only I had enough RAM to make it responsive.

Combined with [Another Launcher](http://www.petermaurer.de/nasi.php?thema=launcher&sprache=english), osX can kick some ass.
