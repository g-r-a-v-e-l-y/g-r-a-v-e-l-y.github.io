RSS is the new "[Push](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/98/all/reskit/en-us/part2/wrkc06.mspx)", for those of you that were reading the tech rags in the late 90's. Er, but it's done right this time.

While furiously refreshing favorite sites looking for updates has been gone for a while, I'd never have thought to look for it for the few sites that I **really** want to be notified of updates. I'm tracking 5 packages right now from UPS and this [UPS tracking -> RSS](http://superjason.com/archive/2004/11/28/272.aspx) trick couldn't come at a better time.
