I write here this morning in an attempt to return from a self-inflicted unhappy state.

One of the reasons I maintain archives of my content here — embarrassing as it always is — is because I force myself to revisit it at times like this, in the hope that I might learn more from my past mistakes than I did the first time through them.

I invite you to play along. Strike through and asides noted as we improve my own past. If only it was this easy!

**aside:** What's with the incessant, murky qualification and labeling and classification of fellow human beings? Lose it.
