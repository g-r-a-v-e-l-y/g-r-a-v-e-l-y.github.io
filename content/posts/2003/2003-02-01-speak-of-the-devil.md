[well this sucks](http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/space/02/01/shuttle.landing.ap/index.html). From CNN:

![Space Shuttle Columbia breaking up on
entry](/images/story.close.landing.jpg)

> NASA officials said they last had contact with the shuttle at about 9 a.m. EST, and it had been expected to touch down at about 9:16 a.m. EST.

>

> The shuttle was at 200,700 feet, traveling at 12,500 mph, when contact was lost.

The space shuttle is old technology but every replacement has had it's budget cut fyi.
