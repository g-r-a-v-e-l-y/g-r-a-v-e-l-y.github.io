The [RIAA](http://www.riaa.org/) website front page has been "replaced" without permission. ;) Because the site is currently down, check the below screenshot for what was done:

The last time they got hacked, it was becuase the admin stupidly treated their [robots.txt](http://www.jokerbone.com/robots.txt) file like a [security device](http://www.riaa.org/robots.txt).

No word on the method used for the current defacement but I would garauntee that it has something to [to do with this](http://uptime.netcraft.com/up/graph/?mode_u=off&mode_w=on&site=riaa.org&submit=Examine). Look at all those reboots!

For more info, check [fark.com's discussion](http://forums.fark.com/cgi/fark/comments.pl?IDLink=403744) and, [the article on The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/55/28817.html).

For my non-geek friends: the riaa is the industry association responsible for the (admittedly understandable) demise of Napster. The RIAA is responsible for ridiculous prices on compact discs. They are [headed by fools](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/futureofip/) that can't or refuse to comprehend how technology is driving their business model to [fail](http://www.boycott-riaa.com/).

I've been [putting off](http://www.eff.org/IP/DMCA/20030102_dmca_unintended_consequences.html) joining the [EFF](http://www.eff.org/IP/DRM/CPRM/20010328_eff_cprm_alert.html) for too long. =/
