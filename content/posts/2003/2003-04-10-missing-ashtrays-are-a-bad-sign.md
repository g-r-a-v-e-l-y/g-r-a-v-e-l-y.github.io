The ashtrays in front of the building I'm in on Wed/Thurs in downtown DC are no where to be seen today.

This is troubling - they only remove them in expectation of 'something going down'.

Anyone have any word on any planned protests this morning in DC of an abnormal magnitude? Searching around is a trap because there are protests somewhere in DC nearly every day.

Yesterday I saw roughly 60 people picketting some building on Vermont Aveâ€¦ all had posterboards on sticks saying something about healthcare and some were playing the bongo's, because that's what healthcare is all about.

The AP (on a few of the floors in the aforementioned downtown DC office building) has had foreign reporters in front of the building delivering ENG (Electronic News Gathering) head-shot reports with nice K St. backdrops every day for the past few months. Today a reporter I did not recognize appeared to be stopping willing passer-by's to get man-on-the-street questions answered. You wouldn't (ok you probably would) believe the nut-jobs stopping and trying to get in line to voice their opinion, people purposely standing in-frame behind the reporter, people walking by throwing / peace signs (ok it's really brittish semaphor for ND, Nuclear Disarmament - hush up Stephen King fans) or just being silly.

What a show.
