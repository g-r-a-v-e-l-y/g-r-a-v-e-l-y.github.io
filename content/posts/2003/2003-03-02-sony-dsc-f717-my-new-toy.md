I just dropped a paycheck on a new digital camera + bag + 128MB memmory stick + gamepad.

Ok, the gamepad is for playing snes on my laptop and was cheap but I bought it at the same time at the same place.

Anyway, here are two pictures that I got today playing with f-stops and the flash. The darts one shows the limitations of a flash placed behind the lense but otherwise they came out ok.

Yes, I _will_ be dragging this to every party and getting candid shots. The memmory stick, I just learned, holds 51 pictures at extremely high quality and approximately 900 at 640Ã—480\. Prepare to have your picture taken drunkasses.
