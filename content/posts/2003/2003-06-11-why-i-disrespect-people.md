Ring&#8230;<br />
<span class="imblue">me</span>: &#8220;Helpdesk, this is Grant..&#8221;<br />
<span class="imred">user</span>: &#8220;i&#8217;m working from home on my laptop and it said it was going into hibernation and then it turned off.&#8221;<br />
<span class="imblue">me</span>: erm you battery died</p>

	<p><span class="imred">user</span>: Well, I need a new battery then.<br />
<span class="imred">user</span>: Order me a new battery.<br />
<span class="imblue">me</span>: Can&#8217;t you plug it in?<br />
<span class="imred">user</span>: I don&#8217;t know my husband set all this up.<br />
<span class="imblue">me</span>: Is there no power outlet nearby?<br />
<span class="imred">user</span>: I don&#8217;t know, can&#8217;t I just get another battery? How long would it take?<br />
<span class="imblue">me</span>: I could put a quote in for one.. could take a week or two.<br />
<span class="imred">user</span>: What do you mean &#8216;quote&#8217;?! A week? I&#8217;m going on vacation!<br />
<span class="imblue">me</span>: Is the power chord plugged into the back left corner of the laptop?<br />
<span class="imblue">me</span>: Can you follow that back to the black box?<br />
<span class="imred">user</span>: hold on.. ok.. yes it is plugged in!.. and I see the black box, it says &#8220;Dell&#8221; on it&#8230;<br />
<span class="imblue">me</span>: Is the green light on?<br />
<span class="imred">user</span>: What green light?<br />
<span class="imblue">me</span>: On the black box.<br />
<span class="imred">user</span>: No, the green light is not on. What does that mean?<br />
<span class="imblue">me</span>: It means that it is not getting power.<br />
<span class="imblue">me</span>: Can you follow that back to the wall and verify that the other end is plugged into a power outlet?<br />
<span class="imred">user</span>: Hold on, let me put the phone down.<br />
<strong>noise</strong><br />
<strong>sounds of stuff moving around</strong><br />
<span class="imred">user</span>: Yes, it is plugged in! I need a new battery!<br />
<span class="imblue">me</span>: Is there a switch on that outlet that needs to be turned on for the outlet to be live?<br />
<span class="imred">user</span>: What do you mean live, there is no switch.<br />
<span class="imblue">me</span>: Was it a power strip or a wall outlet.<br />
<span class="imred">user</span>: uhmm.. a power strip.<br />
<span class="imblue">me</span>: ...<br />
<span class="imred">user</span>: Oh wait, I plugged it into the wall now.. ok the green light is on!!<br />
<span class="imred">user</span>: What does that mean?<br />
<span class="imblue">me</span>: It means it is getting power.<br />
<span class="imred">user</span>: So do you think I should get a battery?</p>

	<p>etc etc&#8230;</p>

	<p>That was as close to a word-for-word transcription as memory would allow. Good times! We debated the usefulness of a new battery for a bit, and I explained exactly what &#8220;being plugged in&#8221; would do for the battery, then walked her through logging back into the machine which was &#8220;locked&#8221; but that&#8217;s boring&#8230;</p>
