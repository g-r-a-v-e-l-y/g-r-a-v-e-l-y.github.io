	<p>Reading long passages of text in a browser is torture. This is only partly because of the screen. Also problematic is the number of words in a line which is often dynamic and when static intended for letter paper, lack of true page numbering and the innability to bookmark the currenlty <i>location</i> on a page in huge scrolling documents. Enter htmldoc &#8212; now I&#8217;m reading the same text in small trade paperback standard width, height and line-height with page numbering, headers and footers. Should I so desire, I can add a few more flags to my command and have a pdf ready to be printed and bound.</p>
