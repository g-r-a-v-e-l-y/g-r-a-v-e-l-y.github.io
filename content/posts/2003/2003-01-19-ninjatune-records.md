I can't [get enough of this shit](http://www.ninjatune.net/ninjashop/index.php?cat=0&type=LP&by=6&code=ZEN76#ZEN76").

I wish they'd open a shop in DC (tips well rewarded if there is one). They don't have the new [Solid Steel](http://www.ninjatune.com/release.php?id=646#tracklisting) release in the [ninja shop](http://www.ninjatune.net/ninjashop/) =/

I snagged the last Solid Steel cd, [Now Listen!](http://www.ninjatune.net/ninjashop/index.php?cat=0&type=LP&by=6&code=ZEN55#ZEN55) at Borders in my huge post-christmas-gift-certificate-shopping-spree and really dig it.
