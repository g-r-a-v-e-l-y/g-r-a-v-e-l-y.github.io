The [UDP exploit](http://www.nextgenss.com/advisories/mssql-udp.txt) currently thrashing many internet backbones isn't really all that interesting, but it makes for interesting graphsâ€¦

**Update**: [Microsoft](http://microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/technet/security/virus/alerts/slammer.asp) is now using the common name for the vulnerability: _Slammer_.
