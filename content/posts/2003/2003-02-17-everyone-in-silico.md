Judging books by their covers is often the only effective way to find new authors - Jim Munroe's [Everyone in Silico](http://4w8w.com/bookmunroe2.html) is no expection.

I picked up a copy of the book at Border's the other day and highly recommend it - I also think I've found a publishing company to start buying random books from: [four walls eight windows](http://www.4w8w.com) - check out their current offerings.

Munroe has an interesting website called [No Media Kings](http://www.nomediakings.com/). Especially interesting is that he invoiced companies that recieved [product placement](http://www.nomediakings.org/letter1.htm) in the novel.

Oh, and his writing isn't bad either.
