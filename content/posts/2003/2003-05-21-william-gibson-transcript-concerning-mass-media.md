	<p>William Gibson has posted a transcript of a recent talk he gave. </p>

	<p><a href="http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/archive/2003_05_01_archive.asp#200322370" >Good reading</a> if you have the time.</p>

	<p>William Gibson is an SF author often credited as the &#8216;father of cyberpunk&#8217;. I read shitloads of SF but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0425190455/qid=1053568075/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/002-2849343-4622421?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Idoru</a>  is the only Gibson novel I&#8217;ve finished&#8230; that was in high school and after reading the blog post I&#8217;m thinking I should re-examine his works.</p>

	<p>Not because I completely buy his vision of the future but because I am now perhaps a bit more capable of digesting the format in which he depicts it. </p>

	<p>I generally cringe, knowing I should not, when pundits describe the internet as an &#8220;unprecedented driver of change&#8221;. </p>

	<p>I don&#8217;t know if it is exactly incorrect but it certainly reeks of &#8220;we are at the cusp of a new age&#8221; thinking which every generation has likely been guilty of in some way&#8230;</p>

	<p>Thoughts?</p>
