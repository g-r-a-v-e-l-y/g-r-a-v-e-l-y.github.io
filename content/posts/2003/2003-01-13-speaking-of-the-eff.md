A few months ago I sent an e-mail to our Maryland representatives. The letter was pre-composed for me by a digital rights organization - all I had to do was fill in my e-mail address street address. Right now I'm too busy working on client issues to dreg up the link - hopefully I'll find it later and update this post so that those of you interested can petition your sentators…

Read on from the response I got from Senator Mikulski…

> January 13, 2003

> Thank you for getting in touch with me. I appreciate hearing from you. I understand your concern that copyright laws have become too stringent. As you know, the Digital Choice and Freedom Act of 2002 (H.R. 5522) was introduced last year to provide increased safeguards for consumers who lawfully obtain digital entertainment. This legislation was not passed before Congress adjourned, and has yet to be reintroduced in the current session of Congress. You can be sure that I will consider your thoughts should the Senate debate this or other legislation dealing with copyright laws in the future. Again, thank you for contacting me. Please let me know if I can be of assistance to you in the future. Sincerely, Barbara A. Mikulski United States Senator
