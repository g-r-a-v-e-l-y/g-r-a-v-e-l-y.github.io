	<p>Groklaw is carrying a complete adaption of The Grinch Who Stole Chrismas relating <a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20031106164630915">SCO</a>&#8216;s story. Great stuff.<br />
<blockquote><br />
<span class="caps">SCO</span> had been caught by this little <span class="caps">GNU</span> daughter<br />
who&#8217;d got out of bed for a cup of cold water.<br />
She stared at <span class="caps">SCO</span> and said, &#8220;<span class="caps">SCO</span>, why,<br />
&#8220;Why are you taking our free Linux? WHY?&#8221;</p>

	<p>But, you know, that <span class="caps">SCO</span> was so smart and so slick<br />
They thought up a lie, and they thought it up quick!<br />
&#8220;Why, my sweet little tot,&#8221; the two-faced leader lied,<br />
&#8220;There&#8217;s code on this tree that won&#8217;t work on my side.<br />
&#8220;So we&#8217;re taking it home to our workshop, my dear.<br />
&#8220;We&#8217;ll fix it up there. Then we&#8217;ll bring it back here.&#8221;</p>

	<p>And their fib fooled the child. Then they patted her head<br />
And they got her a drink and they sent her to bed.<br />
And when Cindy-Lou <span class="caps">GNU</span> went to bed with her cup,<br />
They went to the chimney and stuffed the code up!<br />
