	<p><i>If the future had a slogan, what would it be?</i></p>

	<p><a href="http://frontwheeldrive.com/philip_k_dick.html">PKD</a>: &#8220;God promises eternal life. We can deliver it.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I really really really really enjoy reading <span class="caps">PKD</span> novels &#8212; the interview is neat. Even if you think you have no idea who <span class="caps">PKD</span> is, follow the link, the introduction will remind you.</p>
