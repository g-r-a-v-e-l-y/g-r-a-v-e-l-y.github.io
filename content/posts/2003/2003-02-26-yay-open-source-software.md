It error's like hell in the console - have to tweak that a bit…

First time I've ever done any actual editing of open source source code (or real code at all for that matter)...

Ok ok you got me, it wasn't editing, it was just commenting lines out that looked like they were the culprits for shit I didn't like. Namely the toolbars that gaim draws in the chat screen.

As if we all clickety-clack away typing in what we want to say to someone, then reach for the mouse and click "send".. I know what ctrl-b does, I know what ctrl-i does, I know what escape does…

Now to clean up the button state updates it's trying to process every time i hit a letter key.
