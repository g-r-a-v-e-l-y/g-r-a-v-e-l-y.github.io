What kind of company would use 'mal', meaning bad or badly in their name? Mal, found in words like malformation, maladjusted, dismal, malady, malcontent, malfeasance, and maleficent does not really bring to mind the warmest feelings.

Just looking at this old [Maltron](http://www.maltron.com/) keyboard I just snagged from the trash heap at a client's makes my hands hurt! I can't wait to plug it in and try it out in my cube.
