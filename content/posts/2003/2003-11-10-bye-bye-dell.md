	<p>OK, I can&#8217;t take it anymore. I&#8217;m ordering a <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/index15.html">15&#8221; powerbook</a> tonight.</p>

	<p>The fans in my company-Dell Inspiron 4100 are louder than my old whitebox PIII-500. The 20 GB hard drive has me deleting MP3&#8217;s just to emerge packages in <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">gentoo</a>. It doesn&#8217;t have a cd burner. The screen adds a pink glow to everything when first warming up. The cheap plastic makes flexing noises when I pick it up. It is nearly 90% replaced-under-warranty hardeware. Hate hate hate hate hate hate.</p>

	<p>Linux has been my primary (only) operating system for the past two years or so and the 15&#8221; powerbook is not yet supported fully by Linux &#8212; strange times indeed, I&#8217;ll have to use shareware and non-free software occasionally. Gasp. </p>

	<p>I&#8217;m still looking forward to it a lot. ;)</p>
