<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Eric, reznor, Verdanna, Helvetica, san-serif">Over the course of the past few years,
I have created some artwork related to the band that I am in, Curious Yellow. We got our name not from the classic
film, but from Jeff Noon's novel, <I>Vurt</I>. The graphics on this demo tape are adapted from the book cover of
the story. Hence, this is not a distribution cover, it is something I made as a quick j-card for my personal copy.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Eric, reznor, Verdanna, Helvetica, san-serif">This is a pattern that I have created
in Photoshop and find visually stimulating. Here, the artwork is in more of an albumn cover format, named, again
taking from <I>Vurt</I> &quot;Dreamsnakes&quot;. I enjoy creating things that give the illusion of depth without
utilizing standard perspective, instead relying on layering and atmospheric type perspective.</P>
