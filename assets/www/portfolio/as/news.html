<CENTER><H1>This is the first newsletter to go out to you guys, and I figured it would be a good idea to use it as a basic intro to acid*sun.  It is written html, so that there will be no doubt that everyone can read it. (hehe)  First off, a roster as current as 3-29-00<BR>

 Secondly, there are several things everyone should know about.  We are now on team-play net, and are registered there as a competing clan.  Be sure to stop by often to check the message boards for changes.  Also, there are matches posted there, so take note of the date and time for future matches.  Use the message board within the web page to keep abreast of events, and this will become a good spot for us to keep informed.
 <BR>
 <BR>
Third, please do help set up future matches with clans, after all, we all wish to compete in the highest range of competition, and need your help to do so.  Consider it your duty to help move this clan into the top of the arena, no pun intended.
<BR>
<BR> 
This clan was formed from the beginning as a democratic system, with no real defined leader.  Due to the fact that it has grown faster than expected, it has become apparent that one is needed.  Mark Roberts has been appointed this position, not by default, but because he has shown amazing initiative in getting this clan off of the ground.  We all already go to him for everything, so it only makes sense to make it official.
<BR>
<BR>    
Practices are held on the weekdays, at 10:00 pm central time, and it is requested that you attend at least three of them throughout the week.  Don’t feel as though you have to always be there, but a certain amount of time together is important if we are to work together as a team.
<BR>
<BR>         
This newsletter will eventually have full statistics of all the team members, but as of yet, I don’t have the proper data to compile proper charts.  A web page is being worked on and will hopefully be up soon, thanks to Grant, and that will make communication even more simple, and make this newsletter obsolete.  If you think something else needs to be outlined, feel free to IM me, or email me any suggestions.  Happy fragging!
