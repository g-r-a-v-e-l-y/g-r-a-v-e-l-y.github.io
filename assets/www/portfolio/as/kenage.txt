(%) acid|Ash (E_Kucera@st09_245.dorm.depaul.edu) is trying to send you 1wolf14.zip(747.1Kb) on port 4652.

<kenage> im just a lamer that idles in #acid*sun

<acid|ph8> you are in our IRC channel #acid*sun

<acid|ph8> hehe

<acid|ph8> why?

<kenage> yeah, i just sortuf idle there

<acid|ph8> just curious - nothing wrong with that

<kenage> i dunno, cuz i'm a loser ;p

<acid|ph8> interesting

<kenage> i'm surprised you just now noticed me O_o i've been idling in your chan for weeks now

<acid|ph8> well is there any particular reason/advantage to idling here?

<kenage> *shrugz*

<acid|ph8> ?

<kenage> not really

<acid|ph8> do you play q3?

<kenage> uhh.. heh

<kenage> Sortuf..

<kenage> my windows comp has no 3d card, while my linux one does

<acid|ph8> ok

<kenage> so its kindof impossible for me to play, really

<acid|ph8> and that means..?

<kenage> ?

<kenage> i need a 3d card to play quake

<acid|ph8> there is a linux q3 version available

<kenage> ?

<kenage> seriously?

<acid|ph8> yes

<acid|ph8> has been since the demo's man

<acid|ph8> there's even a demo available

<kenage> i wouldn't know.. i live out in the middle of nowhere heh ;p

<acid|ph8> k

<kenage> for d/l?

<acid|ph8> yeah

<kenage> do you know the addy

<kenage> can ya give me the addy?

<acid|ph8> i'm lookin'

<acid|ph8> http://www.quake3arena.com/demo/index.html

<acid|ph8> the reason i was asking..

<acid|ph8> is because your answers are so cryptic

<acid|ph8> is there any reason for you to lurk here? any reason why i shouldn't kick/ban you?

<kenage> ?

<kenage> why do you wanna k/b me..

<kenage> if you don't want me here, you can just tell me. i'll leave and go idle somewhere 
else

<acid|ph8> i'm just curious as to why someone would idle somewher?

<acid|ph8> i completely fail to understand your intentions

<kenage> i'm an irc whore, i spend grotesque amounts of time on irc.. its just that sometimes 
during the dame im not around (for hours on end) and just idle in channels

<kenage> i dunno how i got in your chan, i must have followed someone in there about a week ago, 
started talking, and then began idling

<acid|ph8> random channels?  

<kenage> not just random channels. i mostly hang in clan vipers chan, #viper, since i know most of 
the members. sometimes someone from another clan will join, and everyone will go to their chan, and 
i'll go too

<kenage> thats most likely how i got here

<acid|ph8> hehe - you don't remember?  i dont' think we've ever played viper

<kenage> i just follow ;p i cant help it

<kenage> and like i said, i've been idling here for a VERY long time now..

<acid|ph8> no offense, but that's strange as hell...

<kenage> but if you don't want me here, you can just tell me. i'll leave

<acid|ph8> interesting

<kenage> like i said, im a loser. i guess i should add 'strange as hell' to the list hehe

<acid|ph8> well, yeah, if you don't mind.. i'm sure there's nothing you could pick up by lurking 
here, and while you may be a nice guy, the irc channel is ours... never said you were a loser, i just 
didn't understand why you were idling here

<acid|ph8> so, if you could please, exit our channel?

<acid|ph8> thanks man

<kenage> bye ^___^

<acid|ph8> thanks again.. when you get q3, come back and invite for 1v1's!

<acid|ph8> we'll play
