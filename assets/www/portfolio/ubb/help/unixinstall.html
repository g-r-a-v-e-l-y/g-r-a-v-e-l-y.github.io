                  called Script_Filename. This will be the path to your script. 
                  Cut off the &quot;/cpanel.cgi&quot; from the end and you will 
                  have the absolute path to your CGI directory.</font> </p>

                  with /Members added on the end] <br>
                  Absolute path to your Variables files [usually identical to
