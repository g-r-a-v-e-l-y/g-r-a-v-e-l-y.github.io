open spots to fill.<br>
<br>
 What we can offer you:<br>
<br>
 - a great time.<br>
 - a more rewarding gaming experience.<br>
 - a frame of code and ethics that we take very seriously and are proud of.<br>
 - a fair amount of experience in the q3 clan scene.<br>
 - a firm, friendly and skilled base of players<br>
. - mature decision making by democratic structure rather than a clan lead as a dictatorship by a 14 year old (everyone 14 years of age: no offence please).<br>
 - a good network of contacts to other clans to organize scrimmages on a regular basis.<br>
 - a history that guarantees that we will stick together and not break up. (thx Grant and Nate for showing your friendship once again).<br>
 - some top notch players who took a likening in us, and ;occasionally even take the time to share their experience and wisdom with us. (thx nB.Gator, tk-Canvas and tk-Silvershark for your patience
with me)<br>
 - a frame of code and ethics that we take very seriously and are proud of.<br>
 - an environment free of these silly military associations found in some clans (again: no offense pleaseeven if you are 14 years of age and militaristic).<br>
 - and finally and most important: friendship and comradeship.<br>
<br>
 What you need to join us:<br>
<br>
 - a good attitude and friendliness.<br>
 - maturity.<br>
 - dedication.<br>
 - a love of quake3arena.<br>
 - time.<br>
 - advanced skill level (don't have to be 1337, but pretty good).<br>
 - more than a dial-up modem.<br>
 - an interest in TDM (Team Death Match).<br>
 - IRC (in which you will have to spend a good deal of time per week) if socializing is not your thing, then you are not what we are looking for.<br>
<br>
 If you are interested you can contact acid*sun in IRC (server: ky.enterthegame.com:6667 channel: #acid*sun), e-mail: m-roberts4@nwu.edu, AOL instant messenger: markrokosmos, gstavelyg, ocia42 or
r3verand.<br>
<br>
 As you can see, our web page is up, but still under heavy construction. Nonetheless, feel free to explore what we have here - you will certainly get a feel for what we went through during the last
days and weeks.<br>
<br>
 acid*sun is back in the community again!!! If you feel that this might be something you want to be a part of, than get in contact with us via the media posted above.<br>
<br>

remaining members of acid*sun. Stereotype has left and pulled most of the other members with him. Unfortunate? Perhaps not.<br>
<br>
 We have decided to rebuild the clan instead of joining TS, although their generous offers to join were and are rather enticing. As of Saturday, I have admin control of the IRC channel and we are
officially *recruiting*.<br>
<br>
 There are a number of things on which one can base a clan. Some choose skill. Some choose personality. Most choose a mixture of two.<br>
<br>
 acid*sun - the *new* acid*sun - will be built up on personality. Most anyone can aquire 1337 5k1llz but once an asshole, always an asshole, and we won't have any of that.<br>

match on sunday night in honor of Mother's Day. Ok.. maybe it's not in honor of Mother's Day, but that's what you can all tell your Mothers when you stay home for the game so that we dont' have to
forefeit. The match is against our good friends, The Specialists, and I know that they have been looking forward to this. One last acid*sun game? With RogerWilco? It'll make you remember the good
times and why you are now leaving/staying (maybe). As usual - IRC is the best way to get a hold of any involved players and the match is at 9:00 PM Eastern.<br>

Some are talking to the TheSpecialists, some to SMS, some are screaming at their local phone company for not offering high bandwith. I have a few ideas of my own that I would like to put on the table
for the existing acid*sun members. We've all given this a lot of thought and we need to discuss things in IRC. If you no longer wish to be involved, that's fine. But please idle irc.enterthegame.com
until we have all made out decissions - don't leave anyone hanging. Thank you!<br>

clan acid*sun. As the summer is comming closer, I have realized that too many members are going to be inactive. I myself will be gone for the summer and will be without game, connection and time to
show up and play. I will try to try out for some clans after the summer and would encourage everyone to do the sma e now. Everyone of you has the skills and character to be an important member of any
clan out there, so don't be frustrated, but move on. If anyone (nate?) wants to run acid*sun and rebuild and start new recruiting after the summer than that would make me very happy, but I fear that
I will not be a part of it no matter what happens. For me this is a very tough decision to make, as you are my friends and my team mates...I hate abandoning you. We will always remain good friends
and keep up our battles :) As I said, what everyone of you does is up to you...but I would love to see you compete further in the q3 community. Join other clans or keep acid*sun alive...don't quit.
Maybe some of you should considder asking our good friends [TS] to give you a home. Some of you could still stick together that way, and who knows: [TS] might be a good place to be. I for myself will
see what I can come up with for myself by talking to other guys we've meet during our q3 gaming experience...<br>
<br>
 Guys, you are my buddies, please understand that I have to do this.<br>
<br>
 I'll be around as much as allways, just without the prefix acid*...although I will always keep our team close to my heart :)<br>
 I'll be around until the 9th of June and I;m sure we will have a lot of opportunities to talk.<br>
<br>
 Cya l8r buddies!<br>

it. There is an accompanying windowblinds theme, also homemade that can be seen in the screenshot. It is highly recommended that if you have little or no litestep experience that you not try to
install it yourself.<br>
