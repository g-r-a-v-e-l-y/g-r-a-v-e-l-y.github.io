<body>
<!--INSTRUCTIONS
This is the template for all pages produced by viewnews.cgi. It should be a normal HTML page, like you'd
use in your site, except with the following "tags" in it. 

<Insert*Title>  Inserts the title of the document
<Insert*Content> Inserts all the content - i.e. search results. This does NOT include necessary 
		HTML tags like <body>, you must insert these yourself as in this example.
		
IMPORTANT: The * in the example above was inserted so that the example wouldn't be confused by
the script with the actual command. Remove the asterisks from the example when using
those commands.
