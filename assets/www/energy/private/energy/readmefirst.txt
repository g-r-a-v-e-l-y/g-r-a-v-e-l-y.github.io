   Download demoplayer first if you do not already have it , its geekboys demoplayer. All you do
   is double click a demo and it plays it!   
   Do not spread demos out of clan mates.. not meant for public stuffz
   
 	   e.MonTy  = e.leeT

Keep viewing this file if  a new demo is in.. I explain and update about it in here.
Every 5 demos of the same map I will make a summary with statistics on those 5 games. 
It should be helpfull. The timer I use to time stuff is called Timer.zip . Unzip to your
baseq3 /q3comp/osp(paks) dir.To use the timer , use the numberpad.

numlock = Battlesuit
/ = Mega Health
* = Yellow Armor
- = Red Armor
. = Quad

Intructions: If I picked up a Red Armor at 2:00 , I hit - ( red armor key) and 00 , it will say 
to team - RA : 25  . It times the items for you.


 Feel free to use my config also ,just don't pass it around please.

** team 1 : Monty , Thrash , Vakal , Noccy ( nice lineup)
** team 2(stx) : Suicidal , Revenant , Vile , Darkstick

Not only was the score close , but we got most quads as well. We had a strong lineup , Me ,thrash
for defense , noccy and vakal can both hold their own good when attacking. Game pretty much could
have gone either way throughout the entire game. A few sticks commented they only played it once
or twice , so who knows. Anyhow we did great. I am proposing a strat for us.
All 4 meet up at RA and hang around untill somebody gets RA , then 2 leave to go to YA/PLASMA.
Hang out there untill they take plasma and YA. Meet back up at RA then( listen very carefull)
When quad respawns in 15 seconds 2 ppl go back to ya/plasma and attacking quad from there, 2 drop
down from the RA to the second floor , and take the pathway to the path across from Quad (if you
are not sure what I just said , ask me ill show you in game). That sounds pretty solid to me,
but if we lost contrl of RA I say gaurd QUAD where RL is and 2 gaurd PLASMA / YA.. What does
everyone think? We can control 2 YA , then attack RA when we have quad and build up to my first 
strat I mentioned where 2 go to plasma /ya once everybody is at RA.Make sure the 2 that go to YA
/plasma one of them got ra.

+++ Great quad control and timing.
--- Still need to communicate more.

** team 1 : Monty , Thrash , Vakal , Noccy 
** team 2(stx) : Suicidal , Revenant+Doggod , Vile , Darkstick

Was another close game against stx.I myself did not do too well , I had too many 1v1 fights and
such. The team did good with Quads and organizing. Revenant had some computer problems so the
HPB Doggod had to fill in for him half way through the game.That is why some of the frag/deaths
stats may be messed up. We still need to communicate more. Must announce when weapons , armors
are available and wait 3 seconds for a response , if someone says yes dont take it if they say
negative , take it.  If nobody responds within 5 seconds , take it. That is my set rule as of now
I was thinking and I believe we MUST get every mega. It will help beyond belief in quad fights.
How we do this is not to attack rail , stay on the ledge below rail and run to the mega button
while someone at plasma gets it. You can go from LG-pathway- to mega button or , ra-pathway-
mega button. Or come up from Plasma -pathway-button. I think that will help.. While the other 2
camp the rl/ lg/ ra...Seal off the rail enterance to quad as much as you can when quad is going
to respawn

+++ Awesome quad timing and gathering
--- Very bad communication , weapon shortage , attacking top rail too much.

*** Died alot at top rail. I think we should avoid that all together.

** team 1 : Thrash , Nolan ( cazm) , MonTy
** team 2 : Mark(stereotype) , Noccy , pete (e.z)

wow , what a close game. Game could have gone either way , the quads helped. Even teams I believe
Nolan did not know what the timer script did , he wasent aware I was announcing armor spawn times
Nolan and Noccy were lagging at times and pete had a 8 year old near em :)..But the game was good

+++ We understood teamwork very well , not a ffa.. Organized attacks
--- We did not execute very well , at times we got sloppy , most often at quad.lot of Team Damage
Good watch , with solid rails from me.

*** Not so bad , Team damage has to be lower ( quad fights) and lets aim for less deaths.
*** we are starting to get the hang of dm7 , need to control mega more tho and less sloppy quad
*** fights , also try to position ourself the most effecient way.

** team 1: MonTy , Noccy , pete(cazm)
** team 2: thrash , Mark(stereotype) , e.z

Interesting game , very close also. It was also decided from the quads and quad fights. Which we
have to practise more on. How to attack quad , with diff weapons and such really helps and from
what location ( rl , 2nd floor , lg , and so on). even teams once again. Close game.

+++ Great RA control , executed quad attacks decent , listened to teamates.
--- We need to adjust strats for your teamate , do not have a set plan. Help them out , just dont
run ra/ rl .. Help out at rail if he needs it.. Mostly be VERY aware of your opponents and have
a bind that says opponents @ rl , ra , rg , ya , etc.. I need to make one myself. VERY usefull.
I had some very nice quad runs that game , with the help from my teamates.

*** I was happy with the way the game was played. I really do think we need to use binds more on
*** dm6. Really try to "think" where the opponent is , makes you more prepared. Save weapons,
*** and if a teamate says "weapon here" say negative if you do not need it so he is not waiting
*** around. Communication and awareness is the key on this map.
