Hi :)

To configure your darkbot, run the ./configure script.

For help and documentation, visit the darkbot site at
http://darkbot.net

If you need instructions on using a darkbot, please read
this page: http://help.darkbot.net/darkbot_walkthru.html

Also make sure you read the NOTES file that comes with this
program, it contains notes that may be important to you and
the proper configuration of your bot.

If your bot is stupid, and you want it to know some general
stuff like acronyms, run ./download_databases to download
some premade databases.
