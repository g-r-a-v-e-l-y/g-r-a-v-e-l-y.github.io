	A BIT OF HISTORY





















	One day, in the recent past, dave and sean founded Diablo Internet 
Services. At first our goal was web design, cgi's, and maybe a little bit of 
that annoying thing called ASP. Eventually, we found DreamBot v0.0.5, and we 
started modifying it. This was our version 1.0 devel of diablo. Then as we 
made more and more modifications, added a configuration pack, we built v2.0 
devel. Eventually, we rewrote the entire bot. This includes the parser and 
command sturcture. We now had extra levels and extra commands. Now, a decent 
bot was born, and it was ours. We kept going, into the v4 devel series, and 
on to 5 devel. This time however, coexisting with v5 devel, we started v
1.0r (release). As we moved through, we released our updates on SourceForge
(http://www.sourceforge.net), and once again, rewrote diablo. As we neared
v1.4r, we completely rewrote the user levels, adding extra levels,
changeing the flags to numbers, and even more. These help files coexist with 
version 2.0d, and will be update periodically. Please visit 
http://diablo.sourceforge.net/ for diablo's main site and
http://diablo.sourceforge.net/online_help/ for updated help files.

	ACCESS LEVELS

	There are 5 technical levels in diablo, one more if you include
absolute 0 access. They are the following..

	Level 1 - Place holder - no extended access (save's settings)
	A Normal ident has no access at the current version above a normal
user except for the fact that a normal ident can have stored hostnames and
weather zip codes.

	Level 2 - Aop
	Aop is the first level which can gain channel ops and change other
channel modes, however, Aop does not include a vast majority of functions
that control the bot.

	Level 3 - Sop
	Sop is the level directly above Aop which allows for general
control over the bot. With sop a user can set Ack levels, ident the bot to
nickserv, force the bot to send a string for raw text to the server and
control channels.

	Level 4 - Admin
	Admin is the level which allows for even more control of the bot,
adding commands such as die, restart, and the ability to add and delete
masks from a users access list.

	Level 5 - Owner
	Owner is the most powerful level on diablo. Owner should only be given 
out to the true owner and trustworthy users. With Owner, a user can use eval and 
debug, lock and unlock commands, and even more powerful, send commands directly 
to the bots shell.
