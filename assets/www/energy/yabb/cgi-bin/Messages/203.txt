:*(|NoccY|NoCtuRn4L@hotmail.com|04/20/01 at 18:49:09|NoccY|xx|0|12.26.69.6|I never thought i would do this but most of you know by now i have left energy. I am really sad over this because it has probably been the BEST clan that i have ever been on. You guys are really a great bunch of guys and i consider all of you my friends. I never thought you could really have any friends online, to my suprise I found this to be false because truly you can. Anyway my reason for leaving is quite easily put, due to our inactivity for the last month or so I would like to play on a more active clan. I understand people all have personal issues to deal with and hey thats cool, Ive got them to. But for whatever is left of Q3 as far as competitively speaking I would like to be on a clan that is more active. So I have decided to join -7, I was actually going to join -7 before I came back to energy but I thought that e. was the same clan it was in the beginning. Only to find out that things change. -7 kind of reminds me of e. in the early stages, the guys practice together every night! which to me is what im lookin for. Our recruiting efforts didnt go very far and our thoughts on a merger never came to light. So in parting I would like to say that I consider everyone in this clan my &quot;friend&quot; and I hope that this doesnt affect that friendship.<br><br>thx again guys &nbsp; <br>NoccY
