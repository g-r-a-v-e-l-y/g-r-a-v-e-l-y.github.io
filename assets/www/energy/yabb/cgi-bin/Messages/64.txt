life stages and the banning of u'hitman|jokerbone|lstave1@umbc.edu|11/11/00 at 03:36:38|admin|question|0|24.23.47.111|OK - here's the link that, of all people, TShollowman dug up for me when i asked him about the Life Stages virus: <br><br>http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/vbs.stages.a.html<br><br>It apears that this virus is generally [i]started[/i] with malicious intents, then spread via its victims through mIRC, PiRCH.. etc - read the link.. either way, if you figure one guys (the asshole) starts it and it goes to 50 people and 5 are infected, then goes to another 50 people, you can have a pretty shitty virus that hardly works with a lot of people looking like that first asshole when they were just victims.. I've not talked to nate or anyone from euphoria, but a ban is a harsh thing.. <br><br>/me harkens back to the kenage incident as a learning experience..<br><br>we had close to 50 peeps in the channel around 4:30 when we left.. we now have.. 26 or so.. this time of night last night we had 36 or so.. it _is_ friday.. idk.. just worried that we did the right thing...<br><br>comments? tom/nate/other spectators ?<br><br>ty<br><br>[i]ed: i'm actualy not worried that we did the right thing - I was more worried about &quot;what comes next&quot; the right thing, should any of you notice someone spreading a virus is a kickban, immediately asap when you learn of it, break out the boot - when it comes to data loss and computer aggravation, shoot first, ask questions later[/i]<br>

In order to prevent the spread of this problem, we are blocking DCC sends of these types of files by default.<br><br>so... a patron of our channel, and a member of our clan (thrash), both were victims of this attempt to spread a virus.<br><br>now, i am very familiar with this virus, i had it. &nbsp;and i fixed it, and i know how it works. &nbsp;it is very possible that hitman was merely ignorant of the problem... and this is fine. &nbsp;HOWEVER, he is still attempting to spread the virus either way. &nbsp;that was the reason for my ban, and until he fixes it i will insist that the ban stand.<br><br>i do have a fix for the virus, should anyone, hitman, or anyone else, need it. &nbsp;feel free to ask if you need it.<br><br>3w0k.<br>
