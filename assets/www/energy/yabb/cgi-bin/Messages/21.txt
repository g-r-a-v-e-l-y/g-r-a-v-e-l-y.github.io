challenged by euphoria|M4d_3w0k||10-10-2000 at 02:48 PM|M4d_3w0k|xx|0|127.0.0.1|On 10/10/00 we were challenged by euphoria for the tp.net ladder.  as it stands now, i dont suggest that we accept it quite yet.  some more practice would be nice before we tried that.  we have yet to figure out what team setup works best for us, and we have yet to have a "full" practice.<br>again, i reiterate what ive been saying all along. we have to have regular practices in order to be competitive.  in case you havent noticed, we are now in the big leagues gentlemen, so we have to take it up a notch to stay there, and to move up in the ladders.<p>let me know what i should do about this challenge, but what im doing now is letting it sit until we sort it out.<p>nate.
