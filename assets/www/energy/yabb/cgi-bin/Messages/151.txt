great idea|Monty|monty_74@yahoo.com|03/01/01 at 17:28:36|Monty|thumbup|0|24.185.233.159|I have been thinking quite alot about this subject. Didnt want to post untill I was sure on my thought. I woudl personally like to do this , but im a player also? &nbsp;Grant said he would be interested.. which is a great idea cuz I think he really knows alot more then ppl think and more elite :) If grant is still up for it.. Im more then willing to help him side by side in strat and other things. I think we can all help eachother on this.. Good post , keep up the work.
Re: omg|flood|supamart@email.com|03/01/01 at 19:57:44|flood|xx|0|64.192.125.205|i'd be totally into one of our guys doing the job. &nbsp;and sure, why can't they be a player too? &nbsp;but again, to make sure that no one gets all hung up over a coaches input, we should really all make sure we agree on that person or people. <br> &nbsp; 
Re: omg|ben|doobman@spam.mediaone.net|03/02/01 at 10:46:23|ben|xx|0|4.18.5.18|i think grant would be a good coach, he's my vote (like anyone else said they were a candidate *cough*)
Re: omg|flood|supamart@email.com|03/03/01 at 18:27:02|flood|xx|0|64.192.125.205|ok, if you guys think grant would do the job right, then he's got my vote too... &nbsp;Plus he said some good stuff in our strat discussion ;)
