General TDM rant|Lemon||11-05-2000 at 02:27 PM|Lemon|xx|0|127.0.0.1|*******First I want to say that I do not claim to be an expert. Feel free to do anything from agree to call me a moron. Your input is appreciated. ********<p>I also am creating a different thread for each map to discuss specifics. <p>General TDM.<p>Strategy:<br>I am open to any strategy as long as we are on the same page. Even if its FFA style (NOOO!!!) then at least let everyone know. <p>The first quad of every game:<br>In the beginning of a game the most important thing is getting a gun. Then don’t worry about frags so much as staying alive for the first quad. Note the time the first quad is taken. When you die type    QUAD at 47. Of course this indicates the next quad will be at 2:47. Knowing the exact time is very important when you are trying to snag the quad at the last second. If the quad is continually picked up at 47 then no more typing. If a quad sits a few extra seconds mid way in the game then re-type the quad time the next time you die.    QUAD at 52.<br>/cg_drawtimer 1    puts the timer on your screen<p>Typing: <br>Only type when you haven’t spawned. I have played on a team that lost a match by 3 and we had one player who got fragged a lot while typing about how he got robbed every time he died. Don’t be THAT GUY =D. <p>Enemy Quad:<br>Don’t spawn until it makes you when they got the quad. Also, use a Quad Dead bind to let teammates know the enemy quad is no longer a threat. Not spawning during quad can keep a quad run at 6-0 instead of 13-1. The only time this doesn’t work is when a clan is splitting each of their players in a different zone trying to cover the whole map. Not spawning will give them all a chance to get set up. Wait for the enemy to do it two or three times…. If they are doing it consistently then note it in team chat next time you die. From there spawn immediately, wait where you are until the weapon appears and then try and hold that area. There is also no shame in hiding (portal basement on dm7) when they have the quad. <p>Team Quad:<br>If the team has the quad area locked down then let the player with the most health/armor have the quad, unless they don’t have a weapon of course. If it is dm6 and there are 7 people in the middle just dive on it even if it means certain death. Team Quad or Quad Dead binds are not needed because the team overlay shows all of those things already. Oh yeah, get out of the way if your teammate has the quad. <p>Battle Suit:<br>As long as you know the battle suit doesn’t take splash damage that’s just about it. On dm 12 & dm 14 I like to assign 3 on quad and 1 on battle suit. It is usually a good idea to head for the rocket launcher after you get the battle suit since people defending that area can’t really hurt you without a direct hit.<p><br>Mega Health:<br>The mega health spawns every 35 seconds. One player (maybe two until we get the hang of it) should be assigned to time the mega. If you pick up the mega OR see the enemy pick it up hit bind, Just Got It, or something similar. When this is hit the player timing the mega should mentally add 30 seconds to time in their head. Ex, 12:45 +:30 13:15. At 13:15, the timer should hit bind Mega IN 5. I know 5 seconds isn’t that much of a notice but it is a lot easier to time that way.<p> Gauntlets:<br>Just say NO! I am a hypocrite here myself. There are times when you are running around someone with a gauntlet and you have a teammate standing back with a rocket launcher that can’t fire because you are in the way. This is real bad when all the enemy has is a machinegun, and we all know machine gunners are the most tempting to gauntlet. Instead haul ass. There might be two armed teammates in the next area waiting to shoot the shit of who ever they see chase you into the room. <p>Armor:<br>Share armor giving best armed player a priority.<p>Ammo: <br>Only pick up what you need unless you are getting it to stop the enemy from getting it. <p>Dying:<br>When you die look at the team overlay and see what area is under team control before spawning.<p>Say_Team:<br>Don’t spam binds. Instead use /cg_teamChatTime "20000"<br>That keeps the team message 6 or 8 high and on the screen in a transparent window at the bottom. Having 4 diff messages like Get QUAD, Mega In 5, Armor @ and ENEMY @ is a lot better than ENEMY @ over and over in the whole window.<p>In Game Gesture:<br>I use force model and visor. His gesture is a loud laughing and waving of the arm. If you don’t use visor use a similar model. The gesture button is hit when you want an item. If you have 5 diff guns on dm7 use the gesture at RA. If you got 150 health and 180 armor use it at the quad. This tells teammates to back off. It is also useful when you are behind a teammate. The sound will let them know not to pick a gun up right after a fight because you need it when they may not have even know you were there.  <br>
