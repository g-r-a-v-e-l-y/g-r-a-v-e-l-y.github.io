Its slated to start midsummer/fall. And (assuming we are all still around) I would like to be invited to play in it. Now i cant speak for all of you but I think you would as well. So Lately ive practiced with all of you once or twice in the past cpl weeks. I think we should step it up and start practicing and playing on tp. and ogl. So what u think?
