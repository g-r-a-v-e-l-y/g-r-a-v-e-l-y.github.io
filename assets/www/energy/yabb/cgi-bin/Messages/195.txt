OGL?|NoccY|NoCtuRn4L@hotmail.com|04/11/01 at 01:08:59|NoccY|xx|0|24.4.253.6|Well i know most of you probably may or may not be into it but the lack of tourneys and ladders out there have really limited us to our gameplay. So flood what do you think? Should we sign ourselves up on the new OGL ladder. The new website has been redone and who knows it may be fun for us. What do you guys think. Cuz i would reall like to play again competitively that is.

Re: OGL?|NoccY|NoCtuRn4L@hotmail.com|04/11/01 at 10:17:24|NoccY|xx|0|12.26.69.6|Well my only reason for wanting to go there is it seems that there are alot of active people on the ladder now. They have redone the whole webpage and cleansed the inactive clans out of it. I understand that it is kind of newbieville but there are some decent clans playing on the ladder. KFC,519,snb, etc.. etc. Another reason is that it gives us the opportunity for more practice so we can play some regularly scheduled matches. I just dont think tp.net is all that active anymore where maybe OGL is. Check ou there new page man its really well laid out. Just my thoughts, cuz as it stands right now there aint alot out there.

Re: OGL?|NoccY|NoCtuRn4L@hotmail.com|04/11/01 at 15:47:57|NoccY|xx|0|12.26.69.6|Im not to hot on it either but man we are so far from active its kinda crazy. I went ahead and signed us up for it. So if you wanna play great!! if not that is fine too. Its all up to you guys, but my opinion is that any time we can get polishing up our skills is great!! so if you wanna sign up for it I have already set it up. Head over to www.ogl.org to check it out. Im just tryin to find a way to keep us together guys thats all, not trying to impose on ppl by any means but it looks like OGL is where all the clans that still want to play are going for the time being.

Re: OGL?|NoccY|NoCtuRn4L@hotmail.com|04/11/01 at 21:12:31|NoccY|xx|0|12.26.69.6|I think we really shouldnt have any problems initially most of the clans are kind of newbies until we reach the higher rungs on the ladder so it will just be more like organized practices =D
