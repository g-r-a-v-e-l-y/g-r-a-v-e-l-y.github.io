Beyond all the BS|NoccY|NoCtuRn4L@hotmail.com|03/26/01 at 15:01:45|NoccY|exclamation|0|12.26.69.6|Beyond all the bs that has been floating around this clan lately. With people leaving and things of that nature. At least a little good has come out of all of this. We Are in the EQL playoffs. Something that everyone associated with this clan past and present should be very proud of. I realize all of the turmoil internally lately has been bringing alot of thoughts into peoples heads.<br>But I think all that can be overcome quite easily.<br>1. With the election of a leader/spokesperson for the clan. (No official team or country i know of does any good without one!)<br>2. A coach (Ive already brought this up before)<br>3. Team harmony (Everyone getting along and taking constructive criticism in the right way)<br>4. Now this one you may not agree with but like i said its my opinion. Recruiting constantly. (Not taking everyone but we should always be on the lookout for great talent. Cuz you never know who could leave next, and then what?<br><br> These opinions expressed are those of e.NoccY and not the those of Internal Energy Inc. Therefor<br>all written consents whether public or private must be adressed to e.NoccY<br><br>anyway guys lets have fun and look at what this clan has accomplished in a small amount of time.<br>Hopefully this news makes you smile cuz it does me<br>=D

I'm not the one that noticed it first, and I don't blame any of you individually, but recruiting has killed us. Energy pulled in four or more members before the plan:b and /u/ &quot;original&quot; members even got to know eachother, much less play together. We had way too many people, and players like me (and a few others) played less and less, to the extent of not bothering to maintain a skill level at all. Others (most of what used to be /u/) were so fed up with the clusterfuck that they left to reform /u/. The &quot;people at the top&quot; (monty, tgm, a few others) were left trying to organise the &quot;people like me&quot; when they lost the &quot;people like /u/ that couldn't stand the mess&quot;, and found it to be so aggravating that they left.<br><br>Point: the idea is that we learn to play as a team and get better &lt;strong&gt;internally&lt;/strong&gt;. Recruiting does nothing but invite chaos into an already messy time. I'm not even sure if I'll be going active again, my skills are at such a low point right now i don't belong in a game at the competetive level that we've been lofted to.<br><br>*shrug*<br><br>That's my opinion of course<br><br>:) <br><br>&lt;3
