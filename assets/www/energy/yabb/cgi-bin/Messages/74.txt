dm6|Lemon||11-05-2000 at 02:24 PM|Lemon|xx|0|127.0.0.1|****DISCLAIMER**** I don’t claim to know what I am talking about. I am putting these on the board so we can all come up with something that works. Agreeing, minor adjustments, not sure or total ripping down and putting up a new strategy is appreciated. Please comment either way. <p>DM6:<br>There are a lot of cramped areas on dm6. This is the only map I recommend a 4-man zone. Also, if all 4 players can get into position for just a few minutes it can lead to big scoring runs. Due to 2/3 of spawn points being on the bottom the best player should probably take this area. <p>Player One: Red Armor/Shotgun by pillars. This player controls the RA. Share when possible but take care of yourself first. After the RA is picked up LOOK for the shotgun. Get it if it is there but never risk the RA to pick it up. The shotgun and RL are both good weapons for knocking the enemy off of the pillars. <p>Player Two: Yellow Armor/ Plasma Gun. This area is high traffic so expect to pick up most of the armor when it is available. When there is no activity in your area stand near plasma gun. This will allow you to not be seen from the rail or by enemies above coming from the RL. It also allows you to peak out across the middle to see if anyone is bouncing up by the rail. This also puts you really close to the re-spawn place on the second floor and the plasma gun. Finally, enemies running up from the bottom will be further up the stairs by YA before they see you making it harder for them to get away.<p>Player Three: Bottom Floor. On dm6 there are 9 spawn points… 5 of them are near the LG. There are two by the pillars, two on bottom floor near LG and one halfway up the stairs between the bottom floor and rail. The sixth spawn point is at the bottom of the stairs near the YA. Once you are armed with a decent gun patrol between the steps by YA to the pillars. 6/9 enemy spawns will be in you area with no weapon! Try and stay out of the center area unless you are chasing an enemy. There is just too much of an advantage for people firing down onto you there.<p>Player Four: Rocket Launcher. Get the gun. Go to area by rail and check rail, drop down to YA, go down stairs and circle outside area on bottom floor to the pillars, go up to RA then head back to RL until it spawns. Of course you are going to fight when you see the enemy. The route doesn’t have to be the same, it does have to be done in less than 30 seconds. If the enemy is holding the pillars or you spent a lot of time fighting on the bottom then cut through the middle and go back to the RL that way. When you leave and come back often there are people with machine guns sitting there hoping the RL will spawn. <p>Quad:<br>The GET QUAD bind should be hit 10-15 seconds before the quad appears. By rushing the quad late we are hoping to trap the enemy in the middle. <br>RA/Shotgun player should drop down to shotgun and come out the door. From there look down but don’t jump until right before quad. <br>YA/Plasma player should come through door on 2nd floor near the50 health. Stay on 2nd floor and fire down. Don’t go to bottom floor until seconds before the quad appears.<br>Bottom Floor player should stay outside of the middle and try to plug one of the two doors. Watch for attacks from behind and don’t enter the center until just before the quad.<br>Rocket Launcher player should stay on top and fire into the middle area. Like the rest don’t drop until the last second.<br>Since we are all dropping down at the last second who ever gets there first will get the quad. Also, if you know the exact second of the quad try dropping on it just to deny the enemy even if you have no weapons.<p>When you die:<br>Look at the team overlay before you re-spawn. See what areas are under control and then head for one of those areas. <p>Binds:<br>Rail UP…. This bind will be most likely used by the RL or the YA/Plasma player. Only use this bind when it is there but you can’t get to it. If you see this bind head to the rail only if you just spawned or if you just picked up the key item in your area (RL, RA, PG).<br>
