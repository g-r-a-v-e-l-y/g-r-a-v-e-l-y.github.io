Re: The demise of internal energy|Lionel|lionel2b@yahoo.com|06/15/01 at 20:57:06|MonTy|thumbup|0|24.185.193.40|Hail everybody. Well, wow... Sooner or later all good things come to a end, but that is not true here. It's good and still going on :) I hate to see everybody call it the end, yes maybe the end to the clan but our friendship bond is so strong and I hope it stays that way...<br><br>I hope people stay in the channel more ( I just got my computer back) and keep updating the site.<br>I would surely like to keep on contact with you guys... I am very thankful for everything, you guys made my gaming experience so much better and most of all.. fun... Wow, playing 3v3,4v4 inner clan- qtv was very nice, though I truely miss when we had our small group and everything got along well.<br><br>It's so hard to post now, so many memories coming back to me. Everybody made a difference in this clan, and all in all- it was a good thing. We needed some conflicts/ change , it kept things alive and going.<br><br>I would like to say I am sorry for leaving the clan... I basically wanted to get noticed and go to some lans- I saw it as my last chance to get noticed and maybe compete in some tournies. I hope nobody took it personal, but I understand if so.<br><br>I would really like to thank Grant, I really felt I should have a lot more before. You added a lot to the clan, your effort and love for the clan showed in the website. I really appreciated all the work you have done.. In games also, your playing time was limited and you were being pushed around when people joined. Something I frown upon now. I just wanted to thank you.<br><br>It was fun guys, and I still hope it will be. I'll be on mirc more often now and maybe we can play some games ( I played thrashy today for my first time in awhile, was so refreshing).. Mark , hope to see you soon..<br><br>MonTy<br><br><br><br>
