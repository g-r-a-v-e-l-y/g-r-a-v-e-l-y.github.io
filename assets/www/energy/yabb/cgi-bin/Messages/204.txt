my departure|flood|supamart@email.com|04/24/01 at 23:49:48|flood|xx|0|24.4.252.224|Hey, I just wanted to say why I left the clan... &nbsp;I know it sux, but for the last month or so, I've been enjoying myself less and less in this clan. &nbsp;Things have just been going downhill since the last fallout from having too many disagreeing ppl. &nbsp;Now it's just to the point of rebuilding, and I just want to have fun again. &nbsp;That would take about a month before things got up to speed in the clan, and I really didn't wanna go through all that. &nbsp;I know, this is terrible timing on my part, and I'm very sorry about that. &nbsp;I shoulda left a couple weeks ago when I was seriously contiplainting it to myself before Noccy or Tech left, but I felt obligated to do something for the clan and thought that I could just make it through the mess. &nbsp;The night Noccy left, I had considered leaving again, and just told myself that I'd give one more attempt by askin some ppl to try out... but after Tech decided to go, that was pretty much it for me. &nbsp;(we'd been in the same clan together since the beginning) &nbsp;I really wanted things to work out, but reality has just sunk in... I just wanna have fun with a buncha guys again like energy used to be. &nbsp;It was awesome playing with you guys when we were active, and I really hope that e does stay alive. &nbsp;<br><br>Best of luck to all of you. &nbsp;<br><br>&lt;3<br>
