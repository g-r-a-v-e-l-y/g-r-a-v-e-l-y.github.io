Recruiting|flood|supamart@email.com|03/31/01 at 19:49:34|flood|xx|0|64.192.125.205|Well, as of right now, I don't think we should recruit.  One of the biggest problems that we've had is that we were recruiting and having ppl leave too much (which in many cases went hand in hand).  It just led to chaos in this clan and made it difficult to be organized which should be our main focus right now.  <br><br>I'd prefer to see what happens in the next week to see if we can scrim every night... this should be just as high as a priority as being organized imo.  So we might want to bring in a person or two if things get worse, but it would be great if we were stream-lined with 5 starters who played every night.  We really haven't had a key set of ppl who played with each other every night even though we've been pretty damn active b4. (oops, I'm goin off on a tangent here) Having those ppl learn about each other could be very good for our teamplay... anyways, this may require recruiting, but I wanna wait and see what happens first...<br><br>What do you guys think?  <br>

I'm not the one that noticed it first, and I don't blame any of you individually, but recruiting has killed us. Energy pulled in four or more members before the plan:b and /u/ &quot;original&quot; members even got to know eachother, much less play together. We had way too many people, and players like me (and a few others) played less and less, to the extent of not bothering to maintain a skill level at all. Others (most of what used to be /u/) were so fed up with the clusterfuck that they left to reform /u/. The &quot;people at the top&quot; (monty, tgm, a few others) were left trying to organise the &quot;people like me&quot; when they lost the &quot;people like /u/ that couldn't stand the mess&quot;, and found it to be so aggravating that they left. <br><br>Point: the idea is that we learn to play as a team and get better &lt;strong&gt;internally&lt;/strong&gt;. Recruiting does nothing but invite chaos into an already messy time. I'm not even sure if I'll be going active again, my skills are at such a low point right now i don't belong in a game at the competetive level that we've been lofted to. <br><br>*shrug* <br><br>That's my opinion of course <br><br>grant
Re: Recruiting|NoccY|NoCtuRn4L@hotmail.com|03/31/01 at 20:42:57|NoccY|xx|0|24.4.253.7|Well i think thats settled then. Anyway lemme add a few things to this if you dont mind. Since I have come back to energy (Now maybe im not around at the right times) but i think there has been one<br>time that we have all played together. Plz correct me if im wrong. But truthfully without some organized scrims or intra's we are fucked!!!<br>I feel bad about grant not playing which he should be but we never play together guys :( So its up to all of you about what u wanna do I would just like us to do well.

Re: Recruiting|Brenton Bates |pimpbrent@yahoo.com|04/01/01 at 06:38:53|vakal|thumbup|0|204.210.238.172|Ummm well its like this I have been here and there... ok I reconize good members when I see them and I reconize GREAT players when I see them. I admit there are some great players here in this clan and some great out of it. People ask me daily to join this clan... and all I can say is... no... i mean.. great players we have lost to 4 because of not recruiting... this is kinda hectic.... I feel if someone would give me some authority I could make more things happen.. i just sit around all day playing pickups when I would rather play with team mates but there are never enough around to play with. Also now more and more people are wanting in this clan cause they see it has potential and is getting better by the minute. I just think we could use a couple of dedicated players.. and I know i could find some cause I see them alll day every day... one would be Kuja. I play with him every day sometimes he scores more then me..... &lt;-- sad.. at tdm pickups.
Re: Recruiting|e.zero-effect|abbadaba@hotmail.com|04/01/01 at 14:33:26|Guest|xx|0|24.13.225.139|I dont think we should recruit either, we have enough members (12) and dont seem to have a problem fielding for matches, but we should practice more, i say everyone try to get on for a practice/scrim around 9-10pm est evreynight, even if like only 2-3 people show up they could hit a server and play some pickups on the same team or 1vs1, or discuss strategies, i think any time spent playing q3 counts as practice. &nbsp;of course scrims with your full team are the best.
Re: Recruiting|flood|supamart@email.com|04/01/01 at 15:05:57|flood|xx|0|64.192.125.205|well, lets wait and see... I for one am going to be playing pretty much every day from here on out... &nbsp;Thrash is playing less, but also has a broken mouse... I think zero, mud, noccy, nolan, and vak are on quite a bit (I forgot what nick you go by Brent srry :) and if I'm playing too, we have at least 6... &nbsp;One thing we can try to do is state that we're here and wanna play in irc every evening. &nbsp;That raises the chances that we'll practice. <br><br>Btw, TGM, Phenom, and Monty left basically cause of disagreeing with recruiting more ppl.. (well all of em would say there is more to it than that, but they all left right after recruiting more ppl which they seriously disagreed with completely) &nbsp;So that's where I'm coming from. &nbsp;<br><br>Yes, we haven't done shite in the last week and that is a big concern, but lets see what happens b4 jumping the gun... &nbsp;We're always hurrying everything and that has caused some of the chaos around here (which a bunch of you never fully saw). &nbsp;I think it's for the best that we try to stay minimal long as we are playing every night. &nbsp;I'll be assertive on getting us to play throughout the week and if things suck, I'll definitely be hard set on getting another person or two into the clan.<br><br>And I know where Noccy is coming from too after hearing what he said about being a manager of a store (stating that you needed to constantly 'recruit' to make sure there are enough workers after some leave)... &nbsp;The difference though is that in a store, everyone has to agree with the rules (which have already been set in stone mind you) and have little say on how things are ran... in a clan that's different. &nbsp;Once you get a ton of members, everyone wants to have their say and be heard which becomes very difficult (resulting in arguments and whatnot). &nbsp;It would suck to repeat the same mistake. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br>I don't want to be the final rule on this, but I hope you guys understand where I'm coming from. &nbsp;Part of being in a clan is to have fun. &nbsp;When everyone starts arguing with each other, and having ppl come in and out of the clan every week at the same time, it simply just isn't all that great. &nbsp;yeah, I'm repeating myself again, but I also want you guys to know that I do agree that playing every night is a top priority also. &nbsp;I just want to take things a bit more conservatively at the moment. &nbsp;Kinda to counterbalance all the insanity that was going on just a little over a week ago.<br><br>So lets just chill for a little bit =)<br>/me lights a spliff<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Re: Recruiting|ricecake|ekucera@shrike.depaul.edu|04/01/01 at 16:00:58|Agamemnon|xx|0|140.192.173.77|grant from chicago again:<br><br>I agree with flood - i've somehow managed to stay in the same clan (through mergers and name changes) for over a year now - I don't know too many people that can say that in this clan or any other. (there are a few - and they are great)<br><br>It's one thing to be playing to get your name known - to be 31337. It's an entirely different thing to be in a clan to hang with friends and play for fun. The members of this clan (and probalby every other clan out there) have slightly different goals that pull it out of shape. Recruiting pulls in members with such haste that it's nearly impossible to get a feel for what the new member thinks and why he's there. <br><br>Since energy started, this has caused (rough estimate) about 80% of our problems. Why invite more? I think this is the longest we've gone right now without adding and losing a few members and it's been very solid. Thrash has cut back on playing time for a number of reasons, as have I. I'm in chicago for the weekend so i've been kind of removed from this whole debate and unable to play much obviously. <br><br>We'll see what the coming week brings.<br><br>*shrug*<br><br>It's getting harder and harder to care. I know that sounds shitty but with the rotating roster that we've had recently I don't know half of you at all.<br><br>=/
