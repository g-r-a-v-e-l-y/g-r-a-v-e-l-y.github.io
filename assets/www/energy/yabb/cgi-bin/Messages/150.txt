It's very aggravating (tdm -and- 1v1) to successfully time armor, sneak around, etc etc, and lose a dual to a guy with a good LR or rail. Unfortunately, this happens to me too much :(<br><br>I'm not the strat master but having -any- eye's in the sky watching over the team is a &quot;good thing&quot; and I do think I pick up a lot that we seem to miss when we play as a internal energy. <br><br>thoughts?
Re: coaching|flood|supamart@email.com|02/27/01 at 16:18:34|flood|xx|0|64.192.125.205|yeah, i just want someone to say, &quot;Hey, you remember when you went this way during this event? &nbsp;You shoulda went the other way and did this!&quot; &nbsp; or to say, &quot;you guys shoulda been here when you were there..&quot; etc........ &nbsp;It just takes some eyes and observing to do that (along with some knowhow on TDM of course). &nbsp;so if your willing to do the job, i'd totally appreciate it! :D &nbsp;we just gotta make sure we that everyone agrees on a coach and trusts them.
