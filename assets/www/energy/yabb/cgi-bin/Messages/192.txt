Recruiting Again?|NoccY|NoCtuRn4L@hotmail.com|04/07/01 at 10:35:04|NoccY|xx|0|12.26.69.6|So where do we stand? are we gonna unlock our roster for more recruiting? I know we started to discuss this last night but as usual we can never get anything accomplished on irc. =D I think if we do decide to start recruiting again that we should be very selective in who we recruit. I know with vakal being out with his connect probs this poses another issue. Im going to try to whip myself back into shape as far as my game goes. It has been lacking lately. (Probably due to me playing t2 which in my opinion for being one of the most anticipated games of the year is kind of a letdown.)<br> &nbsp; I think we need to get enough people to do some inner clan scrims. I know in the past in the early stages that we had alot of issues stemming from recruiting. But I think if we are selective in who we recruit we should have no problems. At this point in time its hard to inner 4v4 we have to goto outside sources to play. Which isnt bad, but i think by inner 4v4's we can talk and communicate with all of the team as far as strategy goes. So what do you think guys? I know im more vocal in saying my opinion on things, and i hope it doesnt offend anyone. Im just trying to help and get some ideas across. Whether good or bad ideas thats all they are.
