question about this leadership deal...|flood|supamart@email.com|03/31/01 at 00:42:12|flood|xx|0|64.192.125.205|Alright... &nbsp;I haven't been around as much lately (mainly due to spring break and today, a crappy mouse), and it's kinda given me a bad start on this whole leadership deal. &nbsp;I was just taking a peek in irc and i saw a discussion made earlier about letting Kuja into the clan. &nbsp;Personally, I feel that I should have a lot of weight on these matters... &nbsp;But I want to hear what you guys have to say. &nbsp;Basically its just about how much power I have. &nbsp;I don't wanna cross any hidden line by just saying that I don't want us to recruit for a just a little bit longer (which is my opinion btw) and calling the shot on that... (or by giving other rules, orders, etc...) &nbsp;So I hope you can see the problem I have here. &nbsp;As I've said, the main thing I am concerned with is making sure we are organized and focused on getting strats for all these different maps, but there are definitely a whole lotta things that I could put my foot down on... like the other day someone suggested to me that I should tell everyone that we can't spam in the prv channel... &nbsp;to me that's a really small thing that I shouldn't be bothering with, but it shows that some ppl seem to want to have a leader with lots of control and I assume there are others that want a more laid back leader... &nbsp;<br><br>So, I'm asking you guys about this shtick before I end up having some person leave the clan cause they thought that some order I gave was outta bounds. &nbsp;Probably the best way to state what you think is good and bad is just by giving examples and I'll respond in what I think... &nbsp;Also, you guys can talk to me any time privately in irc about what you think, but having an open discussion will probably be better for the clan as a whole.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

Re: question about this leadership deal...|NoccY|NoCtuRn4L@hotmail.com|03/31/01 at 18:18:20|NoccY|xx|0|24.4.253.7|Well leadership takes many forms. Whether it be <br>making decisions as far as strategy, clan conflict<br>recruitment, etc. etc. So yes there is power in <br>the word &quot;Leader&quot; which i personally have no <br>problems with. Some ppl are born leaders, Some ppl<br>are born followers. So as far as power goes and <br>whether or not flood has more than any other. The answer is yes he does. That is fine that is what a<br>leader is. As long as it remains a democracy and <br>doesnt become a dictatorship, Im fine with that. &lt;3<br><br> Oh btw Dan/e.Flesh/e.Dan pm'd me last night and was wondering about gettin back into e. I said I have no idea but i would ask for him. So the there<br>is another thing to think about.

I said that we all needed to discuss recruiting, plus I already told em straight up that I didn't want the same incident to happen again... he said that monty was gone and it wouldn't, but then I told em that it doesn't have to be Monty for that to happen.... &nbsp;So he at least understands where I'm coming from.<br><br>I'll leave another thread for the rest on this deallie...<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;
