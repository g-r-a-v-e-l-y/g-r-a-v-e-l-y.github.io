README:  A way of gettin stuff done....|flood|supamart@email.com|03/24/01 at 18:58:42|flood|xx|0|64.192.125.205|Alright...  we need to have a leader, or at least some kinda agreement on how we can get ideas implemented, cause I feel that at this rate, our clan is just gonna fall apart.  I personally think we need a leader, but what's more important is that EVERYONE OF US AGREES on whatever it will be so that we don't end up with more ppl leaving or getting kicked from the clan.  <br><br>If you feel that there is a better way of getting things done, so that we can get everyone on a strat, when or when not we are recruiting, and other ideas, please say so here or on this msg brd, otherwise not everyone is gonna be able to hear what you have to say.<br><br>I feel that just getting a majority vote on some leader(s) is the best and simplest way.  The leader can guide us by listening to others oppinions on things and trying to implement them.  He listens to us, we listen to him..  Right now, we are not getting anything done, and also I'm compeletely sick of hearing that we have new players or lost some players, and I think it's pretty much all due to the lack of having any kind of system.  Currently we are running on a guideless democracy and it's killin us....<br><br>I'm not bound to let ppl get pissed cause they never had a say if that's the best idea.  So lets all at least agree on voting on a leader, before we do that.  Not one person shouldn't be heard, cause it's just that that has tightened the tension around here.  <br><br>I hope we can get things straightened out so that we can get rolling again.  Also, plz say something.. i've spent way too much time writing on this msg brd and having only a couple ppl listen when we have so many ppl in the clan.  <br><br>&lt;3         <br><br>

As many of you may have heard the conversation with me, o5o, grand and thib on irc... A leader is needed to sort of represetn the clan; listen to others and vice versa. He would act as a president and only do actions that satisfy a clan as a whole - not otherwise. We would still vote though on many things. Many of you think that having a leader is a bad idea maybe. BUt it isn't. IT wouldn't be a dictatorship, IT woudl be a represetnative democracy. A leader would be in touch with challenged opponent, admins of ladders and what not. A leader would bring up certain issues to a forum (ie we haven't picked starters yet, strategies, binds). Basically a united clan is needed. A leader will try his best to unite this clan.
