voicecomm?|jokerbone|lstave1@umbc.edu|02/15/01 at 18:57:07|jokerbone|question|0|24.23.47.111|Well.. For the upcoming RM game (our first badlands match, and our first ladder match as a team, ever) RM is likely to be lanned.<br><br>This means that they will all be in the same room.<br><br>This means that we can't trust -any- specatators they have in the server (or maybe we can ask them not to have any at all?)<br><br>Perhaps we should use voice comm software on our end to even the score out a bit? :P<br><br>The discussion in irc has mark and fuct and I all for it, leaning towards battlecomm over rw for a variety of reasons. What do you all think?

It builds more skill and awareness then just saying stuff. Spectators are NOT allowed in the games , only officials if you request one. Which I think is a good idea.

Re: voicecomm?|Lionel|lionel2b@yahoo.com|02/15/01 at 20:34:25|MonTy|xx|0|24.185.233.159|Yea - you pay more attention to binds and I have used voice comm.. I personally like &nbsp;binds better. You are more aware with binds. IMO
Re: voicecomm?|flood|supamart@email.com|02/16/01 at 11:21:47|flood|xx|0|24.4.252.249|voicecomm definitely has to the potential to be a great advantage... &nbsp;like you can say stuff like, &quot;there are two enemies in the RA room... one is camping at &lt;so and so&gt;&quot;... &nbsp;very detailed info... &nbsp;but, I've used the vc and it's just wierd and irritating with all its quirks that people have stated already. &nbsp;There are just way too many problems with it... Maybe once vc gets a lot better in quality... (probably meaning when our net connects get 50Mbps!) then vc will rock. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>-flood &nbsp; &nbsp;
Re: voicecomm?|jokerbone|lstave1@umbc.edu|02/16/01 at 12:07:10|jokerbone|xx|0|63.73.156.12|I was primarily suggesting it as it seems that nobody -has- a full set of binds. I'm afraid mark and I are the only ones using the old plan:b scripted cfg's and monty is the only one with timer binds.<br><br>I dont' know what the solution is but I can't stress enough the important of solid communication - we all should be able to converse with your binds as if we were lanned. It's one thing to be able to kill kill kill and plow through a team without saying much and have a lot of frags but it's not helping the team game or score in many respects. &nbsp;(this is not directed at anyone mind you, we all do it)<br><br>Especially important is timing communication as to when ra will be up, when quad will be up, etc etc. Even if two of your other three teamates are in the room with you when you grab an item, you should still hit a bind saying when it will be up next etc etc etc.. <br><br>I'm not going to go into detail - we all -know- this stuff, we just have to -do- it.<br><br>
