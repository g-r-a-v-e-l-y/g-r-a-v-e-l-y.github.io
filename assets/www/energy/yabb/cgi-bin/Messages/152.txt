Re: thx guys for the fun|NoccY|NoCtuRn4L@hotmail.com|03/01/01 at 13:15:02|NoccY|xx|0|24.4.253.6|basically its pretty simple. It was a simple dissagreement between me and some of the other guys on who should be the starting line up. I never wanted to be a starter in the first place so that is cool. I thought die would be a great starter, Monty thought otherwise, so there is where the disagreement started. I guess i thought my opinion mattered, guess not :(<br>

Your opinion mattered, and what you are saying isn't quite fair I think. You know damn well that all of us were begging Die to start and practice, but he choose not o for good reasons (real life problems).<br><br>You had a lot to say and were heard and your opinion was always respected. I am sorry you got the impression that that wasn't the case.<br><br>What should I say...it hurt to see you leaving, and everyone felt the same way :(<br><br>Too bad.<br><br>Anyhow I still think you are a cool guy (goes for all of you, although I am a bit dissapointed you didn't even tell us what you were going to do, but that we had to find that out when we joined your channel).<br><br>Good luck Kevin, Mike and Josh. I am sorry you were so unhappy in energy. We tried, but somethings just aren't meant to happen. Hope you guys are able to build a strong clan and find more happyness there - you certainly deserve it.
