Strategy on cpm9|pete|pete@andanotherthing.net|03/15/01 at 10:22:22|Tech|xx|0|24.17.74.152|I think on cpm9 we have one guy camp the ra/rg like HOLD it &nbsp;but they need to have a rocket launcher too, for close combat, a guy stuck with only a rail there is a sitting duck, , the guy holding that spot takes ra only if he needs it and calls out to his team to come in and swipe it when they are low, one guy at the RL, that stays there ALL of the time to gaurd it and kill incoming ppl, well that leaves 2 guys to roam the MH and the LG, get extra armor from rl and rg, help out where needed and come back through the teleporter to gaurd the passageways in between , and i think those should be the ONly 2 that go for quad unless they say they cant make it<br><br><br>anyways, thats Techs near complete cpm9 strat<br>
