I think its a great idea.. I think everything is going great in the clan cept for one &nbsp;member right now.. and its dan.. I dont want any more personal attacks from a teamate , I swear dont do it again.. I think we are doing great strat wise , we just need to play.... Dan you really made me upset. This will stop ppl from interrupting eachother in mirc while talking.. 
You want it here it is|Daniel |St.Croix|03/02/01 at 18:14:52|e.dan|exclamation|0|24.42.106.183|Some of the following is out of pure rage an i may not mean some of the shit i say but most of it i probly will take the following as you see it..<br><br>OK you wanted my opion...<br>We are getting owned bottom line..<br>An i think if we were too try the strat i had mentioned to aga we would get alot more done...<br>Now if you notice when you watch cK , stx demos the other team has the hardest time getting a weapon an armor...<br>I fell if we time weapons for the first 2 mins this will leave the other team with no power weapons but shotgun &nbsp;which is queit easy to fuck up...<br>Once we have all the major Weapons it will be a breeze taking majpor areas such as quad , RA making it pretty much a GG for the other team.<br><br>Now there was my strat in short simple terms.<br>To continue on the rest of this monty: i will address who i want how i want.<br>I didnt expect you to take great offence to it but we have some conflicts to work an im &nbsp;willing to work them out. I like this clan an im willing to try to keepo my self in it... but i will explain it like this if i am not wanted in this clan tell me now i will leave with no questions asked.<br><br>Have a Nice Day.<br><br>Dan<br>

I personally think we need to work on basic stuff more . Strat is good , but its heavy. We need to work on playing , just playing with eachother - need to work on communication and such. Strat will fall into place I feel  , I dont want to copy any other team's strat. I dont like to make   reference and say ok STX does it , so lets do it. <br><br>I think we are unique , and it shows outside and inside of games. We need to keep our uniqueness and let us do what feels right , not some strat stx does. I think that branches out many things that will help the clan. If we learn how to play with eachother and let all of us see our weaksides and bad sides we can work on it. Better then just trying one specific strat , while maybe we can be better at something else. Thanks for the post dan. I dont hold grudges but I do like it<br>to be looked upon and thought about. I hope nothing like personal attacks will happen again. Like we all said to eachother when we had a huge mirc chat , Everyone is not attended to argue. I saw you going to a side where you were bringing back other fustrations and such.. No need to.. <br><br>Good part is : we are only getting stronger.<br>
