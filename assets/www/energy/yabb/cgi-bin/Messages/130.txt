New osp/q3comp? post it to the site. New obscure map you just laned 1v1 and loved? Post a link on the news page. Want to say how much you want to have sex with your fellow e members? DO NOT post that on the news page. <br><br>*cough*<br><br><br>irc is a great way to shoot the shit, but as we've seen, even in our private channel, it's too crowded to get a word in edgewise concerning strat, clan policy, whathaveyou. This is what the messageboard is for. To quote what abe lincoln -really said - &quot;we all know everyone is in irc most of the time but all of us are in irc at the same time almost never.&quot; <br><br>Don't bitch to three guys in irc that everyone is forgetting to switch to mg before you die then find out in a scrim two hours later that you are playing w/ a different set of e members. :)<br><br>k. hf.<br><br>Grant

Re: web site content|jokerbone|lstave1@umbc.edu|02/20/01 at 02:13:17|jokerbone|xx|0|24.23.47.111|*sigh* <br><br>keeping this thread alive for lack of input, I'd like to see some discussion regarding -what- we would like on the new website, considering &quot;anything possible&quot;...<br><br>ki's site is nice - do we want xsr style functionality? Demo posting of that nature w/ comments on anything and everything postable by users, etc etc etc?<br><br>What sections do we actually need? rants can become columns, extras can go into an etc category, erm.. irc stats earn their own page, what else? etc etc. <br><br>I'm eager to begin work on this new site as i'd like to create it in a rather &quot;new&quot; format (html4.0 css exlusively) - for those of you in the know, i'm going for a layed-out page with -no- tables... just to see if i can really :)<br><br>if you dont' care / think this site is fine, say so and I'll work on http://www.pixeljuice.n3.net/ which is in bad bad need of a reworking anyway (and might be a bit more fun)<br><br>ty<br>
