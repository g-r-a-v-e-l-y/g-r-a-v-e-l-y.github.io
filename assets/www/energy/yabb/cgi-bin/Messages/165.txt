ZERO EFFECT JOINING|tgm2000|bowler34@hotmail.com|03/11/01 at 23:24:54|tgm2000|xx|0|216.161.68.226|Ok, zero_effect has been playing with us for a few weeks now. &nbsp;I've personally played many games with him and hes a very solid player. &nbsp;He's no all star of course, but he is a cool guy. &nbsp;He will help beef our roster up for intra clan scrims and such. &nbsp;I think hes a good addition. Post your feelings here. :)<br>

He is constantly at the top of scoring 4 on his team and seems like a very good Team player. He's unselfish in his game and has a good aura around him. He's not pushy nor demanding. I vote yes on him joining!
