clan activity and other issues|b:fled|fled@gamelinks.net|11/30/00 at 18:02:31|fled|exclamation|0|24.66.115.111|Hey guys, its fled here.<br>I'd like to address a couple of things that happened this week. &nbsp;First off, Monty left. &nbsp;He was a starter, and from experiece i know for one that he is a great contributor to the team. &nbsp;Loosing Monty this week has been a big hit on plan:b. &nbsp;This is why we really need to try to make practices or at least be informed of who's not going to be around and the one's who can. &nbsp;This week i tried to schedule or at least bring up 2-3 practice days. &nbsp;Apparently the only day that seemed ok for everyone was wednesday. &nbsp;Well after Monty left about 1 hr before the practice was scheduled, everyone was really out of it and most ppl that promised they could or at least would try to show up, didnt. &nbsp;<br><br>I know a lot of you guys are inactive because of college finals and all that. &nbsp;I dont blame you for that. &nbsp;I think if that is the case, we should make an inactive/active list. &nbsp;This helps because 1. if we want to scrim, we know who to ask etc. &nbsp;2. Dont have to guess who's around to have a scrim, because apparently looking on the irc list never works.<br>3. To actually determine whether it is worth the time to wait for other members that are available to play. &nbsp;Because if we only have 3 or 4 that are active, and since there is almost no way for us to play all together, then we might as well go on ETP or other servers to play pickup tdm so we dont lose the things we know, worked on etc..<br><br>I hope none of u take this as bashing any of the members. &nbsp;REally im not. &nbsp;I just dont want to waste time waiting around irc for things to happen when eventually nothing really does =*(.<br>I think thats probably why monty left too..<br>anyhow im outs ,, l8ers

I just can't right now.<br><br>Don't take this the wronf way (you ALL know how much I love our clan), but I simply can't be an active member of thios clan until january.<br><br>I have finals now that are just killing me, I haven't been this stressed and depressed in years.<br><br>Furthermore my private life is just a mess right now and if I have a spare second between tests, that is where my time has been going as of late.<br><br>I am so sorry. I really am. I know now is the time for some people to step up and take some initiative, but I have to say it the way it is: it's not going to be me.<br><br>I will drop in occasionally within the next week or two to say hello to you guys, but technically I will be inactive until january the 3rd.<br><br>I wish you guys all the best. Without Evan and I, two of the core members are inactive, without Monty out best has left. It will be a hard time.<br><br>Especially with three of our active members (fled, dose and soon tanon) being relatively new to plan:b. I know you guys must be having second thaughts now. And let me say this: If you guys want to leave, noone will be mad at you guys, but if you think you can pull through until january, where many of us will be active again, then I beseach you to stand tall now - so to say :)<br><br>I wasn't prepared for this - winter break and monty took me by surprise (the former more then the last I must admit). But plan:b can still be plan:b if you guys show some love now :)<br><br>Fled has mad a respectable effort in getting you guys back on track, but if you don't take a few steps toward him and start thinking of plan:b as a team you all have to contribute too, things will &quot;crumble&quot; and we will loose even more members.<br><br>With tanon, fled, dose, tom, bryan, lemon (?) and grant (after finals) you can still represent the clan in a respectable manner, and not only CAN, but MUST. <br><br>So please give Fled some feedback on more practice times, set some scrims and such up yourself and have some fun.<br><br>I will see you all soon, if not definately in january, when I hope to see most of you wearing our tag and playing the game we love with your team mates.<br><br>all the best,<br><br>mark

Re: clan activity and other issues|b:fled|fled@gamelinks.net|12/01/00 at 17:25:37|fled|exclamation|0|24.66.115.111|well thnx for the feedback guys. &nbsp;very much appreciated it. &nbsp;From what i see on irc, basically there's only 4 ppl around. &nbsp;Me, Dose, Tgm2000/carnage, and thrash. &nbsp;I sometimes see jokerbone around but i dont think i ever seen him chat on irc this week. &nbsp;If thats the 4-5 ppl we get for now, i think we should setup new practice times among the small group of us. &nbsp;ITs not healthy for a team not to play together for a month. &nbsp;Waiting for the inactive ppl to come back in january is not a smart solution. &nbsp;If we have 4, we must continue to strengthen ourselves so we can all go back into competitive state as soon as possible. &nbsp;<br><br><br>Here are my suggestions for practices:<br>Weekday nights (depending on hwrk/tests, anytime after 9pm EST). &nbsp;Friday/Saturday nights i usually have lots of time at night to play since not many ppl do parties anymore =*(....<br>Sundays arent very good for me since i usually go out that day. &nbsp;But sometimes its ok.<br><br>Please leave your suggested times either on this board/thread or on irc topic. &nbsp;Thnx<br><br>

Re: clan activity and other issues|b:fled|fled@gamelinks.net|12/04/00 at 19:18:24|fled|exclamation|0|24.66.115.111|k after going through a lot of stuff, i think its best for ALL OF US to just go inactive a while. &nbsp;Try to play some pickup though if u can so u dont lose too much of the stuff. &nbsp;Hopefully by january things will be running much more smoothly. &nbsp;thnx guys
