NEW SITE|jokerbone|lstave1@umbc.edu|02/23/01 at 17:55:30|jokerbone|xx|0|24.23.47.111|THE NEW SITE IS UP IN BETA!<br><br>haha. just kidding. nobody has told me what they actually want on it so i've not gone beyond look and feel type stuff.<br><br>We've all gone into heavy detail concerning the functionality, now lets brainstorm a little. <br><br>We did very little brainstorming on the plan:b site, which has now been converted to this site. Because of the small amount of brainstorming, we have every section we need -here- but they aren't organised by levels of importance and the site is pretty bland. At least it seems bland to me, after looking at it so much (probably more than anyone else i'd imagine).<br><br>ok. keeping this short and sweet - i have a tendancy to be too specific.<br><br>We currently have:<br>news<br>messageboard<br>roster<br>files<br>matches<br>extras<br>info<br>links<br>rants<br>history<br>irc stats<br>private section<br>file uploading<br>news posting<br><br>how much of that is cruft? How much of that do we need? What more do we need?<br><br>What im' thinking:<br>News<br>Messageboard<br>Roster<br>.plan updates (per e.member)<br>match history<br>demos<br><br>stuff that can go in &quot;extra&quot; places.. not as prominent on the site:<br>info<br>ircstats<br>links<br>clan history<br>extras/filedownloads<br><br>I would like for each section for which it makes sense to have &quot;comments&quot; similar to xsr comment posting (although not -looking- like xsr)<br><br>suggestions? things i could be talked into:<br>javascript irc client to join #energy<br>news posting by non-clan members: get an account / befriend us in irc, become news eligible<br>funny section : rants / irc logs / whatever<br>I'm going to try to make as much as possible updatable via cgi so that you non-html guys can contribute. I did that on this site (anyone can post news) and nobody actually -does- it so.. how bad do we need to be able to?<br><br>erm.. theres some more but i dont' want to scare off any reply's<br><br>:P<br><br>&lt;3
Re: NEW SITE|NoccY|NoCtuRn4L@hotmail.com|02/23/01 at 18:09:03|NoccY|xx|0|12.26.69.11|I was actually gonna ask you to give me an account so that i could post news but if your gonna change it well i guess there is no point.<br>But ya im not html literate. Flash ya i can do it but not html :( kinda funny huh! But ya i would like to be able to post news. Thx NoccY<br><br>p.s. BTW good job yesterday guys i know it was a tough loss and by the time of the third match i was like god! havent we had enough! HEHE but time will get better i really never realized the caliber of some of these players. But never mind with that im confident we will have a good showing here in our short time with EQL we just need to get back to basics again. I even bought a new mouse today. And im gonna run it USB vs PS2 ive heard its better and smoother that way. If im wrong let me know plz.
