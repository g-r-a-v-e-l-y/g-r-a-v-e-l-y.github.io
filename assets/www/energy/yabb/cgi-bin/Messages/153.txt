Re: Recruting|Monty|monty_74@yahoo.com|03/02/01 at 17:35:46|Monty|exclamation|0|24.185.233.159|well I agree.. But let me say this.. We picked up Oleg which I cant believe we did ,he is such a &nbsp;cool guy and a great player.. Really really really awesome. I dont think we can get someone as cool or good as Oleg but if someone else has potential like him , id be willing to.. Im extremely happy when Oleg joined us..
Re: Recruting|flood|supamart@email.com|03/02/01 at 17:40:14|flood|xx|0|64.192.125.205|i agree with yr point. &nbsp;I think we can stop for the momment, but imo, if we find that even one night goes by without any TDM practice happening, we should recruit at least one more...<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Re: Recruting|jokerbone|lstave1@umbc.edu|03/02/01 at 17:55:59|jokerbone|xx|0|63.73.156.12|good point flood but i must say &quot;don't expect me to be around friday or saturday night. I allow RL to come before energy on those nights and those nights only. <br><br>&lt;grin&gt;<br><br>I also think we should stop taking in people. MOnty, i think it doesn't even need to be discussed that when people as open, mature, skilled, and sexy as Oleg seems to be, we don't say &quot;no, we aren't recruiting.&quot;<br><br>Also - Oleg - an ex-member (and host of this web server) wanted me to ask you - &quot;is he russian? Oleg is a russian name...&quot; <br><br>:P
