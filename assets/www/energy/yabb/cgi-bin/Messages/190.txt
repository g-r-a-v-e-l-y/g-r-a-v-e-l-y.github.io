Practice|NoccY|NoCtuRn4L@hotmail.com|04/03/01 at 19:41:03|NoccY|xx|0|12.26.69.6|It is my understanding that practice is every night at 9 p.m. I will try to make every attempt to be at every practice. Unfortunately my job sometimes requires me to be a little late. Most of the time I will be there but occasionally i have to close a few times a week. My store does not close till 9 p.m. So i may be a little late cuz i have a half hour drive home. Hope this doesnt inconvenience you guys. L8er
