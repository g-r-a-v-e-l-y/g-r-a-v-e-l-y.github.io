plan b will be back|tgm2000|bowler34@hotmail.com|12/11/00 at 07:38:39|tgm2000|xx|0|216.161.70.215|Just a couple of quick things I wanted to say. &nbsp;This was my first tdm clan in q3. &nbsp;Im by no means a newbie to quake or tdm, but plan:b took a chance on me and I appreciate it. &nbsp;I've been practicing extensively during our inactivity. &nbsp;Thx Neo for that :) Getting owned countless times has greatly improved my game. &nbsp;I know the loss of monty has seemed to take the wind out of our sails, but I do believe we will bounce back. &nbsp;I know that when we all become active and get some more practice as a team, we will be able to hold our own on the ladders. &nbsp;Thats all I really wanted to say. &nbsp;Im basically just hoping that everyone doesn't give up on plan b. &nbsp;
