203|:*(|NoccY|NoCtuRn4L@hotmail.com|04/20/01 at 18:49:09|0||xx|0|I never thought i would do this but most of you know by now i have left energy. I am really sad over this because it has probably been the BEST clan that i have ever been on. You guys are really a great bunch of guys and i consider all of you my friends. I never thought you could really have any friends online, to my suprise I found this to be false because truly you can. Anyway my reason for leaving is quite easily put, due to our inactivity for the last month or so I would like to play on a more active clan. I understand people all have personal issues to deal with and hey thats cool, Ive got them to. But for whatever is left of Q3 as far as competitively speaking I would like to be on a clan that is more active. So I have decided to join -7, I was actually going to join -7 before I came back to energy but I thought that e. was the same clan it was in the beginning. Only to find out that things change. -7 kind of reminds me of e. in the early stages, the guys practice together every night! which to me is what im lookin for. Our recruiting efforts didnt go very far and our thoughts on a merger never came to light. So in parting I would like to say that I consider everyone in this clan my &quot;friend&quot; and I hope that this doesnt affect that friendship.<br><br>thx again guys &nbsp; <br>NoccY
202|Mergers|NoccY|NoCtuRn4L@hotmail.com|04/19/01 at 20:25:42|0||xx|0|Well some know and some dont. So I thought i would post it to get everyones opinion. Last night Flood, Myself, Mud, and 0fx, offered up a proposed merger last night with the clan -7. This was an idea concocted by yours truly. The only reason i suggested this is that lately our recruiting efforts have been for naught. We rarely practice together anymore, and even if we did we couldnt get an inner 4v4. The reason i kind of picked this particular clan is due to the fact that they remind me of the energy of old. You can constantly find -7 playing on most servers, and normally its an inner clan thing. Kind of like what we used to do. But we all agreed that we didnt want to do anything without everyones thoughts, It was just a proposed idea nothing is set in stone, They havent even accepted the offer yet. So please if ANYONE FUCKING READS THIS please comment and give us your ideas!!!!!
201|QIL5|NoccY|NoCtuRn4L@hotmail.com|04/18/01 at 12:17:21|0||xx|0|Well guys here is where i am at. I think we need to put some serious practice in before QIL5. Its slated to start midsummer/fall. And (assuming we are all still around) I would like to be invited to play in it. Now i cant speak for all of you but I think you would as well. So Lately ive practiced with all of you once or twice in the past cpl weeks. I think we should step it up and start practicing and playing on tp. and ogl. So what u think?
198|Reg ogl.|NoccY|NoCtuRn4L@hotmail.com|04/14/01 at 10:50:29|0||xx|0|Hey aga i have invited you into the clan on ogl.org seeing as how there is no option to join with a pword or anything else. So if anyone else has signed up for the ogl just leave me your username on the message board, so i can give you the invite into the clan through there messaging system. I just happened to search through their database and found aga signed up for it. So if anyone else has once again post it on the message board.
197|Sign ups!!|NoccY|NoCtuRn4L@hotmail.com|04/13/01 at 14:45:56|0||xx|0|Hey guys do me a favor (that is if you want to) If any of you wanna play on the ogl with me head over to ogl.org and sign up!!! We are already rockin and rollin. And OMG the site is awesome when your on a clan. They have a database to send out news to members and stuff like that. Similar to tp. but a little nicer. L8es

181|Phenom` goodbye|Oleg Zhovnir|dkphenom@bellsouth.net|03/24/01 at 22:52:42|0||xx|0|Alas, another one bites the dust.<br><br>I didn't last long. But the times that I had with you guys were great. I particularly enjoyed playing with eveyrone when i just joined the clan. We seemed to have a purpose, motivation and ENERGY. As times went on things got a little crazy and out of hand. Many were plagued by various problems. I thought I could stick it out and wait until the storm settles, but I couldn't. <br><br>In my opinion, I tried to help in any way I could. I thought I had some good ideas for the clan to try. However, the group of ppl that we have right now is very disorganized and is hard to set straight. Many of you have egos and and not open minded, which prevents you guys to try new things or rather MUCH NEEDED THINGS. I still think that for this clan to survive you need A PERSON WHO TAKES CHARGE. I hope you guys can find that person.<br><br>In conclusion, I wish all of you luck whether it be in a clan or individual gaming profiles. I hope you all succeed in real life too. And no matter what, I will try to remember this clan for all the positive things i got from it - all negativity aside. And remember guys that the name of this clan isn't just a tag - energy is all the clan's characteristics rolled into 1 word. Use that to your advantage!<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><br>Oleg

But i do have tdm experience. &nbsp;and i must emphasize that people need to pick positions and stick to it.... holding the key areas of the level is a must to any tdm match. and with all honesty and respect, when i play tdm with ya guys half the time i feel its chaos. like there is no order. &nbsp;yes the job is kill and get the most frags, however that job in itself is much much easier when you own the level. &nbsp;I am perfectly fine with everyone having their own opinions about how tdm should be played, however we have to find out what works for us. &nbsp;which means scrims. a lot of them. and before each scrim, we point out a goal that we want to accomplish. like holding RA! or getting all the quads! these things are important. and you can debate all you want but practicing something and become a **TEAM** is how to be a successful clan. maybe i'm out of line. i don't know. i just think we need to focus on this a bit more, rather than just trying to win frags without any strat.
