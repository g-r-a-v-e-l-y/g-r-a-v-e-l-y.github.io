Ultimo beat ss-elwood for the first place prize in a very very tense dm6 match that had us all holding our breath. The free Bawls gave me the shakes but it was a great lan and well organised by shaka.

By the way if any 9L guys are reading this, any boasting of Shadows' skills are purely due to the fact that they pay me for each instance. <br><br>Now I dabble in CTF once in awhile, but the extent of my strategy knowledge is basically "don't get in the flag carriers way, newbie!". So I was given the proud, manly, <b>superÜber</b> position of...Flag Defence. YEAH BABY! I seriously do not care what position I play as long as I get to play. However, it should be noted that the position sucks ass; especially with a super <i>l33t</i>($$)squad like the Shadows. So thank god my sorry ass did not have to do anything since those super <i>great</i>($$) Shadows were there to mop up and chop up. <br><br>What a hectic game! I basically placed myself in front of the flag and acted like a human shield. After realizing my <b>bio shield of terror</b> was'nt doing the trick I then went on to <i>plan: b</i>(pun), <b>lagged-rail of super annihalation!</b>. This difficult, complicated maneuver is made up of me and my 135 ping snatching up a rail and trying to miss as much as possible to throw off the enemy's concentration, making it easier for my <i>awesome</i>($$) Shadow team mates to bludgeon the confused enemy to death. Its a tough job, but someone has to do it. And I am sure that the strategy played a key role in the 13-0 sweep that those <i>bodacious</i>($$) Shadow guys ran.<br><br>I was going to go into detail about my various killer strategies on the next map(ctf2), Joker's favourite map btw(9L:ask for this map as much as possible, they love it). However, Joker said if I post anymore boring dribble he would shoot my nads off. So basically those <i>dope</i>($$) Shadow guys with serious <b>wangage</b> from Jokerbone(69 frags??) went on to win 5-3. Well thats my recap, a potpouri of heartbreak and cheers. Jokerbone is giving me a strange look, I think hes going to kick my ass for spamming the front page. doh!<br><br>All demos and screenshots can be found at <a href="ftp://kruthles.dhs.org/demos/ctf/1-11-01/">kruthles.dhs.org,</a> hosted by my bi0tch Kruddles of the <i>supa dupa</i>($$) Shadows clan. <br><br></P></td></tr><tr><td>January 12</td><td align=right>octa

This is interesting in that it makes battles louder when approaching from another room -but- it masks some jump noises footsteps that we've all subconciously learned to pay careful attention to during duelz and it's pretty disconcerting.  The rail gun reload sound is new (and annoying). Try getting quad! that quad noise that rings when you fire is much much louder now.. stupid and newbie imo - there's no reason to put the quad carrier at a disadvantage when it is such a key factor in tdm/ctf - the heightened damage is already self-applicable - why shit on the quad carrier any more? Rockets now make zinging noises when they come "too close" in addition to the actual rocket noise they've always made. This is also gheyed and newbie and dissapointing. <br><br>Conclusion - there are other changes that have been noted on tons of pages but these are the first things that hit me... :) Give it a try, it'll be standard soon :/</P></td></tr><tr><td>January 5</td><td align=right>jokerbone
