Some of my background: I have been playing q3 since it was released, never played q1 or q2 much on account of my 66mhz Macintosh performa I had for about 5 years. In 1999, I got a brand new PC amd K7-500, which I just recently upgraded with a k7-850 chip. I used to play tdm off and on, and in 2000 when Ra3 came out, I got hooked and have been playing it like a mad man up to this day. Ra3 is getting kind of shallow, and my clan only plays like once a week in tournies, so I decided I wanted to give TDM a whirl after playing some games with Schwar, (a past member of my ra3 team) the guy from ichorvile. I'm a fast learner, and I love TDM now, so I tried out for energy, and I guess they like me :) My name is Dan, I'm 16 (eeeep!!), I live in Knoxville, TN... I also like horsebackriding, long walks on the beach, and sharing milk shakes to the toon of some 80's classic rock (<-- haha liez) k, that's my post!!! :D</P><img src="images/foot2.gif" width=600 height=1 alt="this is a very thin line and it still loves pixels more than you do"></td></tr><tr><td><p>April 30</p></td><td align=right><p>e.sport

Anyway I'll be updating often in his place.  We are currently recruiting to combat the forced inactivity some members are facing.  Anyone who is interested in trying out please come to #energy and contact any member.  In other news I am taking steps to sign us up for OGL and becoming more active on TP.net ladders, as soon as we are finished recruiting and have ourselves in order expect to see alot of us :>.  Much thanks to grant for hooking me up with the news account and tech for admin functions on tp.net.

Today is my payday at work and for some reason or another my check was screwed up. Not only my check but a few others were as well. So i attempted to contact our payroll dept. Well I have come to the conclusion that I am sick and tired of voicemail. GOD i hate fucking voicemail. It is the biggest crock of shit i have ever heard of. Cuz i know damn well that person you are trying to call to get an issue resolved is sitting there right there at there desk eating bugles and playing solitair on there pc. How many times have you tried to reach someone and u get the standard "press 1 for sales,<br>press 2 for service, press 3 if you would like to speak to a customer service associate" so you press 3...... time passes phone ringing. Voice mail picks up "Hi this is blah blah Im sry i am either on the phone or away from my desk if you leave your name, number and a brief message i will get back to you as soon as i can.... BEEEP"<br><br> Now im convinced that people dont check there voicemail or its just a giant joke. Because i left (i kid you not) 15 messages to day for this bitch. NO CALL. There was a period of an hour where i tried to call her every 5 mins. Guess what? she was either "away from here desk or on the PHONE!!!!" Yea right she isnt on the phone, she's sittin there laughin her ass off at me cuz she knows that my check is fux0red and its a giant joke to her cuz her check was fine. Anyway if this type of shit pisses anyone else off let me know. Otherwise i must be off my rocker!!!</P><img src="images/foot2.gif" width=600 height=1 alt="this is a very thin line and it still loves pixels more than you do"></td></tr><tr><td><p>April 11</p></td><td align=right><p>e.Noccy
