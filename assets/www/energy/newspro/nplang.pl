# By editing this file, you can change any of the messages 
# seen on NewsPro screens by basic - Standard or High - level
# users. The administrator-only screens are English-only, as
# if the administrator did not speak English, all documentation
# would have to be translated as well, which is simply too great a task.
#
# Translators: please leave the above message intact, and in English.
# Do change the language name to the name of your language in your language, however.
#
# Do NOT edit the internal message names, only the messages themselves.
# Example:
# 'DoNotEditMe' => 'TranslateOrEditMe'
#
# If you use the tilde (~) within a message, you must escape it, i.e. \~
# Characters which contain a tilde, such as ñ, are fine and don't need to be escaped.

# For the messages, the boundary of where you can edit is between q~ and the following ~,
# Do not edit outside that boundary.
