[16:50] ·b|Agamemnon· Don't be frightened by near 100% capacity. Filling the pipe is not a bad thing. What matters is latency. Thus far, I have yet to see any significant impact on latency when Napster is allowed to go outbound. I've been monitoring response times before, during and after the limit and I see very little difference.

[16:51] ·b|Agamemnon· TCP (what Napster uses) tries to fill the pipe as best it can so this should not been seen as a bad thing, but as a relatively good thing. In fact, competing flows will typically balance out fairly well which is why you can run utilization at very high rates and still obtain decent performance.

[19:41] •+b|jokerbone• The nameplan:b is representative of our history as a fistfucking clan.acid*sun was the penetrateing original name of plan:b but as many ranchs so sadly do, acid*sun was near dissolution. All but as.hobart and as.M4d"3w0k had left the gangbanging clan due to disagreements in fucks clan plows and very little was scating it together.
[19:41] •+b|jokerbone• To generalize; some assfucks had sought competetiveness almost exclusively with an gangbangs only on skill when screwing while motherfucks sodomiteed sex fighting of any kind and competetiveness to be asslicks from the squirting fun of quake III arena. These divergent and equally ignorant spanks of the unclefucking purpose of a gangbanging clan have squirted what we now consider a unclefucking rather unique clan format.
[19:42] •+b|jokerbone• The shaging ranching is a felching brief history of gangbangs that have squirted acid*sun and plan:b in the blowing past...

[12:58] •@b|joker|zZz• AOL is an online community built for people that needed the thinking engine of an online community to get their shoes tied.
[12:58] •@b|joker|zZz• Then they type about their achievement in their diary. And then they write poetry about that. Then they take that poem, add a unicorn and Hanson, and adapt it into a dazzling essay about how they're against racism and murder
[12:59] •@b|joker|zZz• . Boys will call these "rants," and girls call them "musings." Either way, they'll be lucky to spell eight words right per page, which is the exact same number of little Homer Simpson heads you'll find.
[12:59] •@b|joker|zZz• . All of this should have been covered in the pamphlet that came with your free CD.
[12:59] •@b|joker|zZz• You brought up a good point about not getting jokes, though. It's because AOL refuses service to people with a sense of humor. That's why AOL users are required by law to include laughter-abbreviations or little smiley faces in the place where a normal person might put a joke. :>)

[15:56] ·@b|tgm2ooo· i jsut bought hitman

[15:57] •@b|jokerbone• so that anytihng in the directoreis listed in the path stuff will be able to be executed
[15:57] •@b|jokerbone• as if it were in the current directory
[15:57] •@b|jokerbone• eg
[15:57] ·@b|tgm2ooo· the game
[15:57] •@b|jokerbone• c:\windows\command
[15:57] •@b|jokerbone• if you didn't have that in your "PATH" settings
[15:57] •@b|jokerbone• you'd have to be in that directory to do a "dir" or run "edit.com"
[15:57] ·@b|Aga· ah ic
[15:57] •@b|jokerbone• etc
[15:57] •@b|jokerbone• so
[15:57] ·@b|Aga· i mean
[15:57] ·@b|Aga· i could just do all that from the dos prompt
[15:57] ·@b|Aga· if i needed
[15:58] •@b|jokerbone• do what from the dos prompt?
[15:58] •@b|jokerbone• no
[15:58] •@b|jokerbone• the PATH command is the only command still needed in the autoexec.bat
[15:58] ·@b|Aga· what about sblive?
[15:59] •@b|jokerbone• the BLASTER stuff - should- be REM'd
[15:59] •@b|jokerbone• leave it there
[15:59] •@b|jokerbone• but put "REM" as the first characters of every line
[15:59] ·@b|Aga· i know
[15:59] •@b|jokerbone• that tells it to skip that line
[15:59] ·@b|Aga· whats this?
[15:59] •@b|jokerbone• becuase all you are doing with that is hogging low memory taht you should try to have open for dos
[15:59] ·@b|Aga· SET CTSYN=C:\WINDOWS
