<p>The name <strong>plan:b</strong> is representative of our history as a clan. <strong>acid*sun</strong> was the original name of plan:b but as many clans so sadly do, acid*sun was near dissolution. All but as.hobart and as.M4d&quot;3w0k had left the clan due to disagreements in various clan matters and very little was holding it together.</p>
<p>This short period was a major turning point for us and after a few nights of heated debate in #acid*sun and #acid*private, the majority of the old acid*sun members were inclined to rejoin.</p>
<p>The resulting change in goals, attitudes, and inter-relationships required a new name for what we felt was a new, fresh clan. acid*sun, which we now think of as &quot;plan:a&quot;, had failed.</p>
<p>To generalize; some members had sought competetiveness almost exclusively with an emphasis only on skill when recruiting while others regarded recruiting of any kind and competetiveness to be sidetracks from the fun of quake III arena. These divergent and equally ignorant notions of the purpose of a clan have merged what we now consider a rather unique clan format.</p>
<p>plan:b has no leader.</p>
<p>plan:b has no credo.</p>
<p>plan:b has no direction, per se.</p>
<p>How is a clan with this much internal freedom to survive one might ask?</p>
<p>This seems contrary to the essence of what many clans hold dear, one might say.</p>
<p>on the contrary...</p>
<p>By recruiting only like-minded individuals (which any clan would claim to do but few imho accomplish), plan:b members all have the same common goal - to have fun playing q3.</p>
<p>As a function of our similar preferences, this &quot;fun&quot; is had by playing TDM with competetive aspirations.</p>
<p>To say any more would only serve to restrict our actions...</p>
<p>The following is a brief history of documents that have served acid*sun and plan:b in the past...</p>
