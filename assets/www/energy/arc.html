Great job to all that played in these matches. We came in at the end of this tourney finishing 3rd. Which in my opinion isnt to shabby. Considering we practiced the maps for about what the first 2-3 weeks of the tourney? Maybe im wrong. Anyway finishing the season with an even W/L record of total games 9-9. Diga took the top spot only losing one game with a 17-1 record, and *69 coming in second. Great Job to those teams, (Man Diga has come along way!!!) =D So where do we go from here? Hell i dont really know, Ive posted some of my thoughts on what we should do in the priv. message board, check it out and give some thoughts. Hey if anyone from tp.net happens to stop by and read this. GIVE A PLAYOFFS PLEASE!!! l8er</P></td></tr><tr><td>April 11</td><td align=right>e.Noccy

It seems that once again there has been a rule change that has taken effect. Not like most of us care about EQL anyway now that we got booted from the playoffs, but this latest incident shows the level of incompetence that can be achieved when u try. <br><br> It seems the admins of the EQL have unlocked the roster for clans until April 9th. Oh yea i forgot to mention those rosters were supposed to have been locked since week hmm..... what week OH YEA 7!!!!! This change has been based on the disturbance involving the community with clans disbanding and then there members going to another clan. So to make it "Fair" they will unlock the roster till<br>April 9th and then lock it up again.<br><br> Well some people arent to happy about this. ( Can you believe that?). It seems ]km[ is dropping the EQL over this. Which is sad because they are one of the very few clans out there that have been able to maintain a full roster throughout the EQL. Along with 519,stx,cK, and Ichor. Im sure there are alot of upset EQL clans that are upset with this ruling. And with good right to be!!!! I believe it was Wheat who said it best over on CHUS "This is DONKEY SHIT!!!"<br><br> So i leave you all with this once again GG EQL!!!!!! I think im gonna start a tourney that has absolutely NO RULES!! and then make them up as i go along. Sounds like fun to me!!!!<br><br> Head over to our message board a post away. Im interested in hearing what people have to say.<br></P></td></tr><tr><td>April 6</td><td align=right>e.Noccy

It seems we have been removed from the EQL playoffs. The replacement for us is unknown at this point in time. It seems that Criminal who has been one of the main Admins for EQL has been missing for a couple of days. So someone else was forced to announce it to us. All in all i cant say this was unexpected, could we have realistically competed and won? Probably not. To my understanding though, (correct me if im wrong) but we were a replacement for the now defunct clan 5am. We assumed their points and their standings. Now my question I have is if 5am had not disbanded would they have been removed from the playoffs? If we had assumed "their" record and "their" points, then i honestly dont see what the problem is.<br><br>    Honestly I dont believe we are trying to be whiners about this but the whole thing just seems unfair. So ppl are gonna ask "NoccY what do you propose then?" Well the way i see it we are going after a wildcard spot. The only way I see that is fair to address this is to have a wildcard playoff game. 1 set of 3 games for those that are in contention for the playoffs. That way it makes it even and fair. I dont think the EQL intentionally did this to make people mad but they had to look at it in the fairest way possible. That was to let people into the playoffs that had been in EQL from the beginning. But unfortunately they did not plan on clans disbanding and dropping EQL. So they were forced to make a judgement call. To make it fair though let the teams that are in contention play each other for that spot. That way there is no question who deserves to be there.</P></td></tr><tr><td>April 2</td><td align=right>e.Noccy

Congratulations to e.Flood as being elected the clan leader. This is great news to Energy, something this clan has needed for a while. And i believe Flood is the perfect person for the job. Good Job flood. (So now your the boss, lets talk about my raise!) jk.<br><br>Also unfortunately Energy has made it to the EQL playoffs. This would be great news if all of the negativity surrounding this announcement wasnt directed at Energy and *69. By no means and im sure most of you will agree, did we ever believe we would have made it, but we did due to clans dropping out of the action kr :( and the whole mess with nex. Both our teams have become the focus of negativity. I would like to make this statement to the public. (If anyone reads it anyway) We are not the people that should be taking the heat over this whole mess. Energy and *69 were asked to fill gaps in the tournament due to unfortunate situations. We simply came to learn and play the game, not to "steal" someones playoff spot. We didnt break any rules, we just followed them. Now do i think the rules could have been changed a bit? Hell YEA!!!! But they set the rules. So im sorry for the whole mess, I just wanted to state that Energy and *69 did not cause it.<br>                                 Thx</P></td></tr><tr><td>March 28</td><td align=right>e.Noccy

We have lost a few members, gained a few memebers, and possibly made it into the playoffs for EQL. <br><br>Dkphenom has left the clan along with e.Distortion, Now my dealings with both of these guys were very limited but from what I understand they were both great guys and will be missed. Also myself and Vakal have come back from the "INACTIVE" List :P so hopefully we can help out. <br><br>Unfortunately we got a forfeit win over Team Nex in EQL :( due to the fact that they "Do not play Q3 anymore" So not exactly how we wanted to win but.... Hey it happens. Sad to see a clan like that go. So now we wait to see if we get a playoff birth with EQL After "kr" disbanding and a few other happenings in the EQL we will just have to wait for a ruling.

From what i understand, 519 has been practicing very heavily as of late and it surely showed by our match vs them. gg's guys very impressive. So our welcoming into EQL was a tough one. I'm confident though that with a little more practice we will have a better showing in future matches. In other news it seems that we have possibly lost a member, e.brent or e.Vakal as not everyone may know him by one name. This is particularly sad for me as brent and i have a history in q3 together dating back to the days of zyklonB which some of you may know of or may not. Anyway Brent I hope you decide to come back i hate to see you leave. If you go on to other clans or stay solo I wish you the best of luck in whatever you do. Anyway thx again guys for the gj in our matches so far, I think with some more serious practices we will really start to mesh as a team, there are still some kinks that need to be worked out as we are still not comfortable with each other yet. Also a shout goes out to ichorvile for there match vs. 519 last night. Ichor took the games 2-1 in the series. This after 519 saying that they were gonna "beat ichorville into disbandenment" well in either case gj to both teams.<br><br> e.NoccY</P></td></tr><tr><td>February 24</td><td align=right>e.NoccY
