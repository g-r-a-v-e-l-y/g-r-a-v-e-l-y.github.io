<p>We were in the EQL for a few weeks.  We are still on the <a href="http://www.easternquakeleague.com/standings.html" target="_blank">standings page</a> even though we graciously gave up our playoff spot  - peep Division B.

<pre>8. Sportsmanship:
-------------------
1. Unsportsmanlike conduct/<strong>whining</strong> could lead to a forfeiture of a game, <strong>a player/team's
expulsion from the league</strong>, as the staff see's fit.
2. If there is unsportsmanlike conduct from both clans, the match may be cancelled, and both
teams will be given a forfeit.
3. You must show the proper respect to the league, the staff, and all of it's competitors,
or any punishment may be issued to you pending the severity of the offense.  We will also
give you the respect that you deserve.
</pre>
<p>On the other hand, if you quit the league, enough whining will get you <em>back in</em> so i guess there is a certain parrallelism to that.

<p>Don't mind the eql's quake-site-in-a-box design.  Trying to read bold, tiny, bright red text on neutral gray background is <span class="eqlsucks">certainly a chore</span> but hey, it's the EQL and all "real" quake players know that a quake site without red letters on a black background and a q3 model in the top left corner and q1 texture rips for a border isn't a quake site at all!</p> <br>
