·@b|stereo|· Grantous you around?
•@b|grant• ya
·@b|stereo|· i think we should talk about the DigA thingy for another second...
·@b|octa· he contacted me
·@b|stereo|· you up for it now? I mean you have a sec?
·@b|octa· dose
·@b|octa· ...
·@b|MonTy· yea.. it's a big thing..
•@b|grant• yeah
•@b|grant• shoot
·@b|MonTy· it has it's + and -
·@b|MonTy· I really want to see how every1 feels about those + and -
•@b|grant• personally
·@b|MonTy· I personally deep down inside feel its wrong.. but diga has lotz to offer
•@b|grant• the loss of the plan:b tag, website, and "leadership style" afa our intra-clan management, recruiting, etc..
·@b|MonTy· someone we have been reaching for in awhile
•@b|grant• that's what totally stops me
·@b|stereo|· They need a webmaster Grant: you could have creative control over a major site if you wanted to.
·@b|stereo|· we would have something to say
·@b|MonTy· yea the plan b tag gets me also....
·@b|stereo|· same
·@b|stereo|·•@b|grant• they should join us
·@b|MonTy· intra clan would be lotz more
•@b|grant• well
·@b|stereo|· but i can live with that
·@b|MonTy· dim is a leadership kind of guy , really nice tho
•@b|grant• we could scrim them either way
·@b|MonTy· mark was just atlking to him
·@b|stereo|· dim wants to start a beta team
·@b|stereo|· play on ogl etc.
·@b|MonTy· I talked to him for about a hour
•@b|grant• why not a completely knew clan?
•@b|grant• i still don't like the idea
·@b|stereo|· DigA has been around too long :(
•@b|grant• but i like it better than being bought by diga
·@b|MonTy· dim has been the leader and wont let go of that
·@b|stereo|· yeah
·@b|MonTy· DigA used to be a very good clan
·@b|MonTy· lotz of ppl left
·@b|stereo|· it's like asking 519 to give up their clan and start a new one
•@b|grant• why'd they leave?
·@b|MonTy· now they merged with like 2 other clanz
·@b|MonTy· other clans
·@b|MonTy· they got better , and summer inactivity
·@b|MonTy· last year
·@b|stereo|· maybe we could talk about a new tag?
·@b|stereo|· maybe diga.name ?
·@b|stereo|· hehe
·@b|MonTy· doubt it
·@b|MonTy· Dim dosent seem to budge with the name
•@b|grant• im' just "not interested" basically =/
·@b|stereo|· not the name :)
•@b|grant• you guys are welcome to do it
·@b|stereo|· just a new look :P
•@b|grant• like i said the other night
•@b|grant• but i'm not into it
·@b|MonTy· well would you want to talk to the guys?
·@b|MonTy· really cool ppl
·@b|MonTy· ge1st is prob already one of the best ppl ive meet in q3
·@b|stereo|· you interested in their website?
·@b|MonTy· let's put it this way
·@b|stereo|· as I said you would have a place in DigA
·@b|MonTy· I joined plan b again to be with you guys .. every single one of you
·@b|MonTy· if everyone dosent go..im not going... I would have just joined a better clan then diga
·@b|MonTy· I personally like keeping plan b
·@b|MonTy· but it would be a change.. something we need..
·@b|MonTy· playing is gettign harder now
·@b|MonTy· everybody is in clans
·@b|stereo|· yes
·@b|MonTy· hard to recruit ppl
·@b|MonTy· I feel the +'s are... playing and having more fun
·@b|MonTy· - .. no more plan b , grant's work , tag , and less control of leadership
·@b|MonTy· It would feel like as grant said
·@b|stereo|· the way i see it is like this: plan:b as a group of friends is stronger then ever, but as a q3 clan we've had it :(
·@b|MonTy· someone is owning us
•@b|grant• agreed and agreed
•@b|grant• couldn't -we- merge with another clan?
•@b|grant• eg, take another clan under our wing?
·@b|MonTy· diga is huge
•@b|grant• instead of being shepherded by diga
·@b|MonTy· 20 + ppl
·@b|octa· i dont think he means diga
•@b|grant• ya i hate their tag
·@b|stereo|· the about DigA is that we could really learn something
•@b|grant• i don't
·@b|MonTy· well what other clans are there?
•@b|grant• but from what i read
•@b|grant• diga is cs
·@b|octa· ...i heard dj was looking to merge...
•@b|grant• and nobody is ever around
•@b|grant• etc etc
·@b|stereo|· nah...
·@b|stereo|· they have 5-6 active q3 players
·@b|MonTy· 5 active ppl play q3
* b|octa shrugs
·@b|octa· satan mentioned it
·@b|MonTy· hmm grant has a good idea
·@b|stereo|· dim and geist being the giants
·@b|MonTy· what other clans are going through what we are?
•@b|grant• a fuckload im' sure
·@b|stereo|· lc. was :(
•@b|grant• q3 is dying
·@b|MonTy· well if you look at it that way
·@b|MonTy· I really dont see a huge benefit from joining diga
·@b|MonTy· the losses hurt alot
·@b|MonTy· besides playing
·@b|MonTy· more
•@b|grant• we can do that with out being w/ them right?
•@b|grant• i mean
•@b|grant• they want to scrim, we scrim
•@b|grant• etc
•@b|grant• we could be w/ them w/out being in them and ruled by them
·@b|MonTy· it;s not the same
·@b|MonTy· but ya
·@b|MonTy· well not in tourneys
·@b|MonTy· for instance
·@b|MonTy· we face diga first round
·@b|MonTy· in badlands
·@b|MonTy· as of right now.. im leaning more towards no
•@b|grant• well what -do- you want to do monty
•@b|grant• yeah?
·@b|MonTy· we have to make the decision by monday
·@b|MonTy· which is pushing it
•@b|grant• ya
·@b|MonTy· cuz of badlands rulez
•@b|grant• why are you leaning towards no?
·@b|MonTy· the losses are too great
·@b|MonTy· just the idea of no more plan b , tag , leadership
•@b|grant• k.
·@b|MonTy· in this clan , everyone is by best online buds... I will never find that in another clan
·@b|MonTy· I can trust everyone here
·@b|MonTy· doubt I will beable to do that with diga
·@b|stereo|· i don't want to sound like I'm putting down plan:b, but the group would still be together, we could still hang in these channels, tag is fashion - fashion is not that important, and dim is a good leader and we as a group would have a strong pull
·@b|MonTy· tag is a meaning of the clan.. its a symbol
·@b|MonTy· it's just the feeling
·@b|MonTy· imo
•@b|grant• agreed
•@b|grant• afa peeps go
·@b|MonTy· I would "feel" different with a DigA tag
·@b|octa· #plan_c would be dead right?
·@b|stereo|· nah
·@b|octa· even #plan_b?
•@b|grant• you know
·@b|octa· dude are you sure mark?
•@b|grant• i could get a few more bodies for us like
•@b|grant• now
·@b|octa· is the leader of diga cool with us in our priv channels?
·@b|octa· wouldnt that seem like were not trying to blend in?
•@b|grant• you all realise that i've been playing ctf w/ houseofshadows for quite some time
·@b|stereo|· yes
·@b|octa· yesh
•@b|grant• shadow'mayoke is more thatn interested in playing tdm w/ us
•@b|grant• he's better than me
•@b|grant• maybe tgm's level
•@b|grant• hasn't played tdm in a while but he's a strat-concious player and i've known him forever
•@b|grant• eg - drove to qcon w/ him and let him stay at my house for a week and stayed at his apt for a lan party a few weeks ago
·@b|stereo|· so you mean he'ld be double claning?
·@b|MonTy· is he cool?
•@b|grant• ya
•@b|grant• he's pretty cool
•@b|grant• he's around all the time
•@b|grant• jsut like i am
·@b|MonTy· you feel he would blend in good with b?
•@b|grant• absolutely
·@b|octa· yeah he rocks
·@b|octa· imo...
•@b|grant• the only bad things i ever hear about him
•@b|grant• is that he goes off about strat
•@b|grant• he's very picky
•@b|grant• for ctf stuff
·@b|stereo|· say have you guys thought about asking euphoria for a merger?
•@b|grant• likes laying out strategies on their messageboards
•@b|grant• etc
•@b|grant• should I have him join plan_c?
·@b|stereo|· they're haveing the same start problems after winter like we arew
•@b|grant• sure
•@b|grant• talk to them
·@b|thrash· ya
