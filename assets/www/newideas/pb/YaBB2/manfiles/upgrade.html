<title>*** YaBB 1 Gold *** Install Instructions and Readme</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#5d7790" text="#FFFFFF">

<H2>Upgrade Instructions:</H2>

These are general instructions on how to upgrade your existing YaBB forum from ANY previous version of YaBB. Please 
follow all 4 steps!

<P><B>Step 1 - Configure Settings, Template, and Language Pack</B><BR>

First open 'YaBB.pl', 'Reminder.pl', and 'PrintPage.pl'. Each of those files contains a path to your server's Perl location. Generally, 
this setting is correct, but Perl is installed in different locations. For example on a Windows or WinNT machine, your Perl 
path should probably be set to #!C:/Perl/Bin. Check your server for the proper path and change accordingly.<BR><BR>

Open 'Settings.pl' and set the variables inside as follows:
<BR>Required Settings--&gt;
<pre>
   <i>require "english.lng"</i>        Change to language pack you want to use
   <i>$mbname</i>			The name of your YaBB forum
   <i>$boardurl</i>			URL of your board's folder (without trailing '/') - where YaBB.pl is located
   <i>$cookieusername</i>		Name of the username cookie (no change necessary)
   <i>$cookiepassword</i>		Name of the password cookie (no change necessary)
   <i>$mailprog</i>			Location of your sendmail program (generally "/usr/sbin/sendmail" or similar)
   <i>$webmaster_email</i>		Your e-mail address (must have the slash in it as shown "webmaster\@mysite.com")

   <i>$boarddir</i>			Absolute path to the board's folder (usually can be left as '.')
   <i>$datadir</i>			Directory with messages (can be left alone unless you wish to move elsewhere)
   <i>$memberdir</i>			Directory with member files (can be left alone unless you wish to move elsewhere)
   <i>$boardsdir</i>			Directory with board data files (can be left alone unless you wish to move elsewhere)
   <i>$sourcedir</i>			Directory with YaBB source files (can be left alone unless you wish to move elsewhere)
   <i>$vardir</i>			Directory with variable files (can be left alone unless you wish to move elsewhere)

   <I>$facesurl</I>			URL to your avatars folder (without trailing '/')
   <I>$facesdir</I>		        Absolute Path to your avatars directory
   <i>$imagesdir</i>			URL to your images folder (without trailing '/')
   <i>$helpfile</i>			URL to your help index file (http://www.mysite.com/yabbhelp/index.html)
</PRE>
The remaining settings in Settings.pl are not required, but are only feature and layout variables. It is recommended that 
you do not change them until you get YaBB working! After that, have fun.... This new Settings.pl file is required because 
there are many new settings.

<BR><BR> Open 'template.html' and modify the layout as you wish (to make it look like your site). <B>Important Step-></b> if 
you wish to use your existing template, you MUST add the tag "&lt;yabb copyright&gt;" or you will get an illegal copy notice 
error on your forum! Note: the tags beginning with "&lt;yabb " MUST REMAIN in the template.html file. You may move them 
around as you wish as long as you keep those tags on lines BY THEMSELVES. The tag "&lt;yabbnews&gt;" has been removed in 
this version, in favor of the NewsFader script. You may insert this tag if you would like the old text news format back on 
your YaBB. (But be sure to set $ShowNewsFader to '0' before you put that tag back in, or you'll have the news twice on the 
Board Index.) It is recommended that you do not change template.html either until you get YaBB working!

<BR><BR>** Open 'english.lng', or the language pack you wish to use, and edit the text strings as you wish. The new language 
file is REQUIRED because there are approximately 200 new strings from the last release of YaBB.

<BR><BR>
<P><B>Step 2 - Upload the script/image files</B><BR>

Place the files from the downloaded zip into the directories as shown below (and please not that the directory names 
as show may be different from the ones you actually use):

</pre>

<BR>
<P><B>Step 3 - Delete Extra Files</B><BR>

Next, you will need to delete Search.pl from you /yabb (or your board's directory). It has been replaced by the 
/Sources/Search.pl and /Sources/SearchResults.pl.<BR><BR>

<BR><B>Step 4 - Running Maintenance Upgrade Links</B><BR>

You will notice a new "Y1Gold Upgrade" section in the Admin Center when logged in as an Administrator. 
You must click (one at a time of course) both of these links so YaBB updates it's totals files. When you first 
upgrade, it has to create these files anew....<BR><BR>
