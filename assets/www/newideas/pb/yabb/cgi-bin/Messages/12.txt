I have class on Teusday night... all other nights are open although I would like to reserver Friday and Saturday nights for me-time. Sundays, as they have been in the past, are an ideal time.. perhaps one additional night a week in addition to pickup practices we can have at random intervals throughout any given week?<p>I <3 you nate. <p><g>
