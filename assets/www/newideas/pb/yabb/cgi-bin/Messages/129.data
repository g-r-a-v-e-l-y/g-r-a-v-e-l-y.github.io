history text!|stereotype|m-roberts4@northwestern.edu|02/12/01 at 02:34:30|stereotype|xx|0|199.74.102.94|This is a brief attempt at throwing together <br>a temporary history text for people, interested in our founding, to read up on.<br><br>This is by no means at all a final version, so<br>hence: please give me all the feedback you have - thx.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------<br><br>It all started in the month of Feburay, 2001, when a few guys<br>from plan:b were talking about joining Digital Annihilation.<br>Plan:b was on the merge of inactivity, and it became apparent <br>that a drastic change was needed to get the group into a <br>competetive spirit again.<br><br>The dillema was, that on the one hand plan:b didn't want to give <br>up their identity by simply joining another group like {DigA}, <br>and on the other hand they understood that they, by themselves, <br>had no future either. <br><br>After some discussion, plan:b decided to go ahead and ask euphoria <br>if they would possibly be interested in merging with them to create<br>something new - something that would enable both clans to keep part <br>of their identity and at the same time enable them to grow into clan<br>with true potential and spirit.<br><br>Within an hour it was obvious that both clans were a perfect match <br>for each other. Euphoria's great character and mentality, alongside <br>their dedication and spirit were precisely what plan:b was looking for.<br><br>Internal Energy (meaning euphoria) seemed to be the perfect name for <br>our new team, and within minutes plans for our new irc channel, tags, <br>website, tournament schedule and intra clan structure were formed and<br>put into reality within the same day.<br><br>Now only a few days after our merger, we feel a greater love and passion <br>for the game then ever before and are looking forward to what we consider<br>a very promising future.<br><br>We, energy, are more then proud to have created something beyond our <br>wildest imaginations, and have promised to ourselves that this clan,<br>unlike many others, is here to stay - and we mean for good!<br><br>&lt;3 &nbsp;<br><br>--------------------------------------------------

That is why I posted it here, so that all people (mostly ex-u members) can add, correct, improve and spice up this draft.<br><br>So come on...you need to actually add sentances, write your own 2 paragaph histories - gimme some facts. We'll merge the essays into one really good one then.<br><br>How did u feel about the merger at first? What concerns were expressed in your private channel as we were talking?<br><br>C'mon guys don't be lazy!<br><br>&lt;3
