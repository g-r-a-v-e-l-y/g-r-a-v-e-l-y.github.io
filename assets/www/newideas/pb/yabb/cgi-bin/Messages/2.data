Tyson...|CC||11/02/00 at 21:27:41|CC|xx|0||Dude, just wanted to let you know that you just had to tell us that you were with a new group, you didn't have to tell us you were leaving the quake scene altogether.  We know we are not a group that focuses on competition and you should have known us enough to know that we would have been cool with your switch.  Anyway none of that matters now, congratulations to plan:b, you have one hell of a member and one hell of a talented player.  Wish you guys luck in whatever you do and maybe we could even play a match sometime.  Take care and don't be a stranger Tys.
