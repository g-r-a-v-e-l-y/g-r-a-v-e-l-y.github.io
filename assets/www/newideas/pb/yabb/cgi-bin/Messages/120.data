id software = lazy asses?|jokerbone|lstave1@umbc.edu|01/28/01 at 14:45:10|jokerbone|heart|0|151.196.244.196|Ok. this is something that, as most people that know me have long understodd, has bothered me since quake 3's release. <br><br>It's full of bad UI!<br><br>It's full of lazy programmer decisions!<br><br>It's full of inconsistencies!<br><br>I've run across very very few quakers that still put Id at the right hand of the Lord (a certain tribes clan comes to mind and puts a bad taste in my mouth) but I've never found a messageboard thread or essay/rant on precisely -where- all the problems lye. <br><br>I would like to start one. Please post any problem you've had with quake3 that was solved by a stupid console command, or any lack of intuitiveness discovered in the UI or any general problem that &quot;they should've known better&quot; that you've encountered. <br><br>:)

I'll not number these, but for a &quot;first post&quot;:<br><br>Demos:<br><br>the demo creation and/or viewing aspects of quake3 is horrendous. <br>[list]<br>[*]To record a demo, one must type arcane commands into the console beginning with &quot;record&quot;. I'm no fan of wizards, but they [b]are[/b] great tools for linear operations of this sort. To have no way to doing it in the UI is a painful act of lazyness. <br>[*]The g_sync(h)ronousClients settings is also a show of profound lazyness. Why can't /record automatically check this? [*]Id has known for quite a few games back that demo's are a popular and oft used feature of fps games - it should be in the list of control binds in the setup for a user to hit &quot;f9&quot; to start recording, at which point a dialog would pop up asking for a filename. This -should- be the advanced option :). By default, the demo bind should just name the demo by the players that are playing and the map (in the case of 1v1) or the map and the date and the demo pov playername in the case of teamplay/ffa.<br>[*]watching demos:  !!!!!!  wtf !!!!<br>Ever downloaded a demo and then went to watch it using the &quot;demo&quot; item in the menu? Of course not! You'd never find it!  Most of us use the console and type dir/demos or somethign similar, then scroll up to find it.  Wonderful. Putting up with this during the demotest was fine, putting up with this and -worse- in 127g?  Give me a break.<br>[/list]<br>there are probably a few other problems w/ demos that I'm not thinking of at the moment but this is a start to the thread :)<br><br>Grant<br>
Re: id software = lazy asses?|ben|mayoke@houseofshadows.dhs.org|01/30/01 at 17:24:07|Guest|xx|0|64.109.194.24|i would say alot of it is a design desicion rather than lazyness. &nbsp;I for one am completely at home in the console. &nbsp;That doesnt mean that they should have skimped off quite as much in the UI as they shoulda.<br><br>-&gt; old test had a nifty &quot;exec config&quot; dialog that was nice and later removed<br><br>-&gt; demos UI is horrid for long filenames (duh)<br><br>-&gt; The entire fav servers and blue/red team UI is just utterly unintuitive<br><br>-&gt; cant doubleclick on something as 'ok' (i.e. ingame browser, must click &quot;play&quot; not d-click the server)<br><br>these are the ones that come to my mind. &nbsp;Then again, the q3 community is in the gutter right now, why add to it mr poopie pants? :p
Re: id software = lazy asses?|jokerbone|lstave1@umbc.edu|01/31/01 at 21:02:46|jokerbone|xx|0|151.196.251.159|good point w/ that last remark - the q3 community -is- in the gutter right now. nobody cares anymore. Quake 1 didn't didn't die out nearly this fast - q3 has barely been out a year and the &quot;community&quot; is bored and tired of it. Lets hope that the Badlands Ladder (new from teamplay.net) brings some life back to the game-that-could-have-been.<br>
