starting line-up|stereotype|m-roberts4@northwestern.edu|02/14/01 at 04:28:04|stereotype|xx|0|199.74.102.94|We talked about this earlier and to my surprise noone started a thread yet, so I will be the first to throw in my 2 cents.<br><br>First off: no-one take any offence! I do not mean to hurt anyone in this team by critizing them or leaving them out of the discussion. I have the deepest respect for everyone on our team, but we have to pick, and that's where I hope we will be mature enough not to make this personal.<br><br>My &quot;dream-team&quot; might look something like this<br>(- critique + praise):<br><br><br><br>1) e.Monty<br><br>- You tend to be too tempramental at times and lack overall perspective of your actions. Sometimes for example little actions such as disconnecting immediately after a loss give the team a feeling of insecurity.<br><br>- Limited availablity during daytime.<br><br>+ I think you have exceptional qualities off an on the field. <br><br>+ You're dedicated to the team and you have the best combat skills as far as I'm concerend.<br><br>+ For me you're a sure thing - and one I trust would never let the team down when we need you.<br>You do have a temper, yes, but when it comes down to it, you are one of the nicest guys I know and are overall an inspiration and example for the team.<br><br><br><br>2) e.thrash<br><br>- Of all players I know on our team you are the one I never really know what to expect from.<br>You tend to be more dependant on form then the average player.<br><br>- For my taste you don't communicate enough with your team when playing.<br><br>+ Having said that, I think you are one of the smartest teamplayers I know. You seem to have this natural eye for a situation and simply put: manage to stay alive.<br><br>+ When you are &quot;on&quot;, you are REALLY &quot;on&quot;.<br><br>+ All in all I have the highest respect for your abilities, and think you can hold your own to everyone when you have a good day. <br><br>+ I have known you long enough to trust your abilities and believe you should be a firm starter.<br><br><br><br>3) e.Noccy<br><br>- I haven't know you very long and therefor don't know how reliable and consistent you really are &lt;3<br><br>+ From what I have seen the past days, you are a good step ahead of many of us and seem to have good eff % as well.<br><br>+ Although you haven't been around that long, we are a new clan, and I do belive you deserve to be a fulltime starter.<br><br><br><br>3) e.vim (e.die)<br><br>- Availability.<br><br>- Haven't seen you play at all hardly, and when I have, your ping was well above 200. In my opinion a true starter needs to be there at least 50% of the practices to get to know and find his place in a team. A few 1on1's and a scrim per week isn't enough in my opinion to be a starter.<br><br>+ Again having said that, you have amazing skills as a player, and are in a position in which you have earned the respect and trust of your former teammates.<br><br>+ From what I understand you have a lot of experience in TDM, and that will do a new team very good.<br><br>+ Overall, I think you should be a firm starter, if you show your team that you care by attending a few more practices during the week. I know that everything has been very spontanious, the team is new, and therefor I am sure you, as we all, will find it easier to plan once we have decided on regular times for practice. Tentatively a starter in my opinion.<br><br><br><br>5) e.flesh<br><br>- Limited availability during the day and late nights.<br><br>- Like Noccy, you just joined and therefor will need to prove that you are consistent and that the team can count on you when needed.<br><br>+ Great raw q3 skills. <br><br>+ Very solid teamplayer from what I could tell.<br><br>+ All in all I think you definately deserve to be a starter, if you keep up the good work and are able to show up when needed. Great player, great guy - a &quot;yes&quot; in my opinion.<br><br><br><br>6) e.the-rest<br><br>We still need to get to know each other of course.<br>Most of us are fairly equal in skill and experience. <br><br>If needed I would suggest that the players who attended most practices the previous week before gametime, with the best pings to the server the staters agree on playing, should fill a vacant spot.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------<br><br>As I said earlier: The critique was not ment to offend anyone at all. Everyone mentioned, everyone on our team,has earned my respect and &lt;3 :)<br><br>We need a firm starter team, or talent will be wasted in my opinion. A good team is a team that knows each other by heart and can trust each other. Although these requirments go for the team as a whole, a tight group of 5-6 players who play together every practice should be the best way to go, and the ones I listed are in my opinion (doesn't have to be yours, that is what this thread is for) the most promising players on our roster for the reasons mentioned above.<br><br>You know I &lt;3 ya all :)))))

Re: starting line-up|NoccY|NoCtuRn4L@hotmail.com|02/15/01 at 10:33:03|NoccY|xx|0|24.4.253.7|Mark thx for the kind words. As with others my availability during the day is somewhat limited as well. Nights are really the best time for me as I have a fulltime job. I appreciate the kind words on my skillz but once again i do get streaky<br>there is still alot of things that need to be learned on my part. But i believe the more we play the better we all will get. But as far as reliability is concerned, I play virtually every night. So ther should be no problems there.
