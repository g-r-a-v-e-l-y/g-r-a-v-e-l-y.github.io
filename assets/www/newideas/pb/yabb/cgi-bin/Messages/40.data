Some comments on teamplay and plan:b|CS6x||10-20-2000 at 03:50 AM|CS6x|xx|0|127.0.0.1|Hey guys,<p>It's 2 am now and I have a midterm tomorrow morning, but I'm not tired, so I figured I'ld share my thoughts on some recent developmets with you.<p>First of all, I am proud of what plan:b is turning into, and I think we all agree, that this clan is develpoing in a way we could not have imagined a year ago.<p>Much has been happening recently.<p>Monty, Ryan, Tom and Bryan have joined our group, to expand plan:b to eleven members total.<p>We have started scrimming and will have our first match on comming saturday.<p>This is all very exiting, and quite frankly the idea of simply competing again and playing TDM on a regular basis is already pretty satisfying.<p>But we are having problems too. In addition to Evan, Ryan and Nate's ping issues, we seem to have considerable problems performing well as a team.<p>Now with Monty and Tom we have two very strong players and as soon as Ryan becomes more familiar with TDM and his ping settles, he will be able to pull some serious weight too.<p>But although individual skills can sometimes tip the game in favor of a team, one player will not win the game for us. <p>We can only win as a team. Now I know that all of you of course know all that full well, and in many ways I am telling you absolutely nothing new here, but it is time to wake up now and do some serious thinking about teamplay.<p>I want to address a few points now. And I want to make one thing clear: these points are not guidelines ... they are not a list of things to do, from which you can pick "a few". These are not points which you have to extensively practice to understand. Of course I don't expect everyone to be perfect - least of all myself :P - but when you make a mistake in TDM, I want you to know what you did, and what you could do next time to do it better.<p>The first thing to internalize - as Monty pointed out -is to play for the team and for the team alone. You'll get your pat on the back if you come in as highest scorer, but in the end if you chase people around, thereby leaving your position and abandoning your team mates, you failed as a team player and seriously harmed our clan's performance. <p>In dm7 i.e.: you go to get the mega and instead of racing back immediatly to the RA to take in your position, you decide to take the route over quad back (which is still ok)...then you see an enemy appearing from the quad doorway from the YA...in my opinion if you pick a fight at this moment you seriously endangered all other players on your team. Even if you make the frag, you will have wasted 30 seconds in which the 2 players guarding RA have probably been over-run. That means: your 1 frag win has resulted in the death of 2 teammates and the loss of RA, thereby turning the game into FFA for a certain amount of time. In addition we will probably have sacrificed 2 weapons and maybe even had some unlucky spawns. Furthermore the 4th player at RL might have raced for RA to help them...probably too late as almost always. He will have died as well. <br>Your 30 second battle and 1 frag win in conclusion might have resulted in the loss of RA, armor, a hand-full of weapons and the death of 3-5 teammates. <br>Score: enemy 5 - plan:b 1 and us being in a shit situation to recover for next quad. In conclusion your 1 frag might have lossed the game.<p>Now this was of course highly speculative and at times exaggerated, but I think it isn't that far fetched.<br>The one thing we all must understand, is that TDM is NOT about who gets more frags in 20 min. It's about who dies less in 1.45 min. Then you get quad and score frags in 15 seconds and then live off of spawn frags for another few seconds. <p>The perfect game looks like this: 1.45 no enemy contact. Get quad, regain position and kill a few enemies and the do nothing but power-up for another 2 min. etc. etc. etc.<p>Now naturally this is not the way TDM functions in reality, but that is the goal with which one must play as a team. <p>Another typical situation and no-no:<p>You are close to the passage way from quad to ra and get shot in the back....now what do you do? Turn around and defend yourself?...answer: no.<br>You run 2 more steps to where your teammates are, let your teammates take over and go get health and stay alive.<p>Another thing:<p>Someone calls "move to quad". Now what? answer: nothing....just move to quad and pick a door way to secure, stay there until quad spawns or until you die -now nothing in the entire game could be so important that you decide to move away from quad. There is nothing more annoying then calling quad and only you and one more are actually there. Enemies come in (3-4) ... the two of you die...and look who comes into quad only 5-6 seconds later...your teammates! ... just a few seconds too late ... probably you ran into an enemy and figured why not rake up a frag and fight it out...congrats! -&gt;you F*$@#% your team in the ass again ;)<p>Now I must appologize for the tactless way I am bringing this across, but there is no compromising way to say it. If you make mistakes that is great...seriously ok...but not if you play your own game during the 20 min. Your job in TDM is nothing else then help, support and fight for and with your team at all times and at all costs...if you don't see that, then you might want to think about the nature of team games for a bit.<p>Another situation...you have a PG with only 12 cells left and see a SS in front of you...obviously you won't be able to do much with 12 cells, so you decide to pick up the SS. Now here some people might argue with me, but I think you should at least think about whether or not your ammo problem can be solved by picking up ammo instead of a new weapon. Great example is RA in dm7. YOu have plasma and hardly any ammo left. Now instead of picking up the next rail or even better going for the PG down at the portal, why don't you wait for the PG ammo to spawn in the dorrway towards the RL.<p>Armor: priority list when taking armor:<p>1) Quad carrier<br>2) Teammate with weapon<br>3) Teammate with only MG<p>If you freshly spawned and have no weapon, then leave your hands of of it...it won't do you any good anyhow, unless you see a weapon in immediate range or know that a weapon will soon spawn.<p>It goes without saying, that if you have 50+ armor or 150+ health, you should definatly leave armor for teammates...even if they only freshly spawned.<p>If you fight a battle where you know that you will not come out superior, then focus your attention on a) running away b) taking damage off the enemy with the most powerful weapon (better hurt the guy with RL then a guy with MG) and c) switching to mg before you die (unless you are at distance to the enemy and can predict that a teammate of yours will reach your dropped weapon sooner then the enemy).<p>When guarding a position: Only one leaves at a time. If at RA with 4 players, there must be 3 at RA at all times. If you know that a teammate is getting mega and you see the plasma spawn, then wait until your teammate enters RA before you dive for the PG.<br>If you play with 3 at RA and 1 at RL instead of 4 at RA, then make sure you have 2 at RA at all times and call for help at the first sight of an enemy.<p>There are many many many more things we need to pay attention to, but it is late now and /me is tired.<p>I &lt;3 ya all!<p>Mark<p><br>
