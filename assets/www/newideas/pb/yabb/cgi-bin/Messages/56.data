sign up on OGL now|stereotype|m-roberts4@northwestern.edu|11/07/00 at 00:55:54|stereotype|xx|0|199.174.178.191|Ok. So we are on TP.net, but competion is strong there and I feel it might be nice to have another ladder to somewhat fall back on. Now OGL might also be a somewhat easier ladder to schedule matches for. No more inactive teams BS. Here if you challange a team they have 2 days or so to respond or they auto-forfeit :) ... it works vice versa also of course! ... so be prepared to see a bit more gaming action.<br><br>Now what you need to do is the following:<br><br>go to www.ogl.org and register with your tag on (!), then you must log in (!) by typing your name and personal PW in the bottom fields and hitting log-in.<br><br>After that hit deathmatch to your very left. Then choose &quot;open team&quot;. There will now be an icon somewhere for you to &quot;sign in&quot;. Type your name, the team's name (plan:b :P) and the join password (see private forum or msg me). Then hit join team. Done. I expect everyone to have done so by Wednesday night. <br><br>gl
