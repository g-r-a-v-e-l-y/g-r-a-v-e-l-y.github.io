I just saw http://www.killerinstincts.com/ and decided to hate myself.<br><br>*cough*<br><br>j/k - although their site is very very leet.<br><br>anyway - there's some new functionality here on the internal energy site.<br><br>For those of you that dont' know, our private page is reached by clicking on the &quot;e&quot; in the top right corner of the site.<br><br>login: planb<br>Password: sun<br><br>On it, you will find a number of files and a few links to important stuff like news posting (broken atm i think) and some other stuff..<br><br>Today, i've added a new feature for personal private space on the server managed by a cgi file manager. I need to have vladimir (ex-plan:b member / server admin) password the directory, so be careful about where you access it from etc..<br><br>Personal space exists currently for monty and gladiac - if any of the rest of you would like one, let me know.<br><br>fuct:::::: this is a BSD machine - i'm looking into how difficult it will be to get this messageboard ported over to IIS. If i get it ready, we could -really- use that t1 line *cough* - this server is rather slow :( talk to me :) - as it is the cgi won't run on iis which would be a major bummer..<br><br>anway - check out the personal pages! enjoy!
