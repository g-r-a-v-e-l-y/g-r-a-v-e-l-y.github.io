what is grant up to?|grant||10-12-2000 at 12:36 PM|grant|xx|0|127.0.0.1|Hi gang. This UBB turned out to be quite popular if temporary and poopy.<p>I've been thinking that it may be a bit more usefull with more "forums" - e.g. - "Strat" (with seperate sections for dm6, dm7, dm2, and dm14), "practice", "matches" and maybe a few more.. i also need to talk to aaron about making private forums a la kns' board. if that becomes the case, i'll make our current board "private:b" or something and add public forums for matches and discussions..etc..<p>What do you guys think?<p><br>In other news - this one should probaby be a new thread , concering my absence at most of the recent practices. Where have I been? Well: school really sucks this semester.. no, wait, it always sucks, but this semester , i think i'm going to try and pass all my classes! W00t! Also, I've been borrowing kns.gama's car for the past.. oh.. month or so.. it died on sunday and will probably cost me a lot of money to repair before i return it to him. Also, i was supposed to find a new apartment to live in over the summer.. due to a number of circumstance, two of the guys that i was going to move in with have lost their minds and now hate me.. long story.. so.. i'm not on the lease at my apt... i'm paying rent, but still not supposed to be here (i don't _want_ to be here).. also, a number of things happened in my personal life over the weekend that have kept my computer shut down.. oh... it helped by dying for a bit, but that is fixed.. <p><br>blah blah.. what does this all mean? Whine whine! it means that if i'm not around 24/7, it's because i'm doing "more important" things, it doesn't mean i don't respect the blah blah.. i think that's clear enough..<p>k. let me know what you all think of what i said at the top of the post. ty.<p>Post here more often! I check it like four times a day and it's been at 28 (now 29) posts for quite some time :D<p>Grant
