NEW MESSAGEBOARD|grant||10-20-2000 at 12:17 PM|grant|xx|0|127.0.0.1|no, it's not up yet :(  I'm having some strange perl problems that should be hammered out soon.. this messageboard will completely replace this lame ass UBB and the stupid problems we've been having with the private forums.. <p>eg - please don't post to the "matches forum" for a bit.. IIS is giving me some strange permissions errors<p>in other news.. i came very close to picking my box up and chucking it off our apartment porch last night (we are on the third floor overlook a playground) :D<p>my mouse drivers aren't loading so i'm losing my binds for rocket and rail.. changing them to the KB isn't impossible but it's very strange to not be able to snap to the right gun becuase i'm not used to them.. last nights scrim was the first time i experienced the problem and i didn't want to take the 30 seconds it would take to rebind them so if you saw me emptying an MG into a wall last night- i was trying to force a switch to a bettergun that i had stupidly picked up...<p>watching last nights game, combined with these sort of problems that a lot of us are experiencing right now leads me to believe that on a better day, we could definitely take xL :D  they weren't owning us.. their teamplay isn't a shitload better than ours, we just sucked (pardon my critique) at some vital things as mark and monty have helpfully pointed out..<p>my mouse isn't my only boxen problem and i may be formating the HD and doing a fresh install in the next few days.. this would take the messageboard down but i'll be quick (i hope) and have a 2 gig backup drive empty and ready in my computer for when i get around to doing it..<p>ermm.. nothing else comes to mind.. if i think of anything i'll let you know.. <p>ps: to see theperl error i'm getting, go to:<p> <A HREF="http://23.24.47.111/b/cgi-bin/yabb.pl" TARGET=_blank>http://23.24.47.111/b/cgi-bin/yabb.pl</A>  <p>(if it will let you- i haven't looked too much into what kind of directory permissions are set up there as-of-lately)<p>Grant<br>b:jokerbone
