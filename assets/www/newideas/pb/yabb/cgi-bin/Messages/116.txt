Your &quot;last words&quot; to Alissa - a woman i've heard nothing but the most insane things about - should memorialize both your relationship with her and it's heavy influence on us never being able to get you to play anything but rune those last few &quot;high-bandwidth months&quot;. &nbsp;<br><br>Call her. <br><br>Right now.<br><br>No, i don't care if she's at work.<br><br>and say:<br><br>&quot;GG&quot;
