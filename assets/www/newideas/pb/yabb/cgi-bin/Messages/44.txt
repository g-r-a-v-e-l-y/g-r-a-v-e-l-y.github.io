Match against method: recap|CS6x||10-21-2000 at 03:18 PM|CS6x|xx|0|127.0.0.1|This was for me the biggest disapointment since the founding of plan:b. A match was by mistake scheduled for the afternoon. Ok, it happend, it won't happend again, but although the time was inconvinient, our starters seemd to have known about the time and agreed to show up for game time.<p>Now: two starters did not show up. I couldn't connect due to some issues I don't know how to fix. A few other of our players were not here during the match.<p>As a result we had one starter start at 100+ ping and naturally got raped by a team we could have otherwise crushed.<p>0-1 record on TP.net and situation that will not be tolerated again. <p>This can happen once. If you can't play let us know and that is fine. Just not to show up hurts noone else but your team and is therefore not acceptable.<p>Next match I expect to see our starters and even out our record again.<p>
