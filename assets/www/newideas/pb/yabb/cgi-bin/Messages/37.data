Also if we have a match soon tell us ahead of time cuz ill watch some demos of them if they are around.. Also who do you think is good to challenge? I think we shouldent start off by facing too strong of teams , ones with less experience. We dont want our first few games all losses. Even tho it seems I learn more from losses then wins.<br>Peace<br>b:Monty
