q3statPHP v0.2 by dan@d-an.net
	
	This is a re-write of my first version, it doesnt do anything new yet
	but im working on more stuff. It does look a bit nicer though, and
	hopefully WORKS.
	
	TODO:
		player search -- will search all servers in your serverlist
		auto refresh option (you can easily add that to the templates)
		maybe add the ability to use a master server

	Files:
		q3stat.php
			main script, few options to edit

		q3stat.css, templates/q3stat.tpl, templates/q3statl.tpl
			edit these to change the look

		includes/class.FastTemplate.php3
			need this to make it work
	
		Example of server list (qservers.txt by default):
			quake3.com
			blah.net:27961
			anotherserver.com

		
	If something doesnt work, or you have any ideas or suggestions drop me an email.
