Alice's Adventures in Wonderland<br>
<br>
March, 1994  [Etext #11]<br>
[Originally released in January, 1991]<br>
<br>
*****The <a href="http://promo.net/pg/">Project Gutenberg</a> Etext of Alice In Wonderland*****<br>
******This file should be named alice30.txt or alice30.zip******<br>
<br>
Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, alice31.txt<br>
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, alice30a.txt<br>
</p>
<p>
We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, for time for better editing.  We
have this as a goal to accomplish by the end of the year but we
cannot guarantee to stay that far ahead every month after that.
</p>
<p>
Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all <a href="http://promo.net/pg/">Project Gutenberg</a> Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.

<p>
Information about <a href="http://promo.net/pg/">Project Gutenberg</a> (one page)
</p>
<p>
We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $4
million dollars per hour this year as we release some eight text
files per month:  thus upping our productivity from $2 million.
</p>
<p>
The Goal of <a href="http://promo.net/pg/">Project Gutenberg</a> is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is 10% of the expected number of computer users by the end
of the year 2001.
