      <li><a href="images/md.gif">Commerce One Media Database</a> - My first experience as Project Lead was with the inception of this insite database for the storage and aquisition of various media. The working beta version, created with a team of mixed interns and full-time employees, stored hundreds of liscenced and original stock photography and clip art images as well as many small sound and animation media created by other members of the creative team at Commerce One. I was primarily responsible for the direction and focus of the project and the html generated in the pages while others worked on the graphic design and asp backend.
      </li>
      <li><a href="volt.php">VOLT</a> - During my internship at Commerce One I had the opportunity to create this poster advertising software that our company was creating for NASA. I came into the project after the initial poster design was approved in low res but all of the 300 dpi work and changes are mine. The software allows for the coordinated control and scheduled use of both the Chandra and Hubble space telescopes from a single networked application.

      <a href="http://home.jokerbone.com/newideas/index.html">Pixeljuice beta</a> - pre-themeing (planning stages) of this site. :)<br>
      </li>
      <li>
      <a href="http://home.jokerbone.com/oldwwwroot/index.html">beginnings 3</a> - broken, old, frame based "private site" of mine - later to become p-juice. (for a little insider tip - "beginnings" is the title of an <a href="http://cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-767167/target=buyweb_purchase/ddcn=SD-7674+11599+2" target="_blank">unfinnished</a> Jimi Hendrix song otherwise known {via the <a href="http://cdnow.com/cgi-bin/mserver/SID=1750953610/pagename=/RP/CDN/FIND/album.html/artistid=HENDRIX*JIMI/itemid=770311" target="_blank">woodstock recordings</a>} as "jam back at the house". If you don't think it's one of the coolest songs ever, you ought to look into therapy - quit being so uptight.)<br>

      <a href="http://home.jokerbone.com/energy/index.html" target="_blank">Internal Energy</a> - I made this homepage for my quake 3 team dm clan around november of 2000. Working on it was my first experience with scripting and real "functionality" on a site w/ the mesageboard, news posting cgi, and an extensive password protected private section allowing further news posts and file uplaoding / downloading. This site has an extensive number of older versions no longer live :). Try <a href="http://pixeljuice.dhs.org/energy/web/planb/logo.html" target="_blank">the first one</a> on for size. yikes.
      </li>
      <li>
      <a href="http://home.jokerbone.com/alice/index.html" target="_blank">Alice in Wonderland</a> - This site was an experiment with css and readability. It is also the first place I attempted to play with the "theme" notion but I never implemented it there - pixeljuice got it instead. It was a bench assignment at my internship to create a site using nothing but text (my forte apparently). Do whatever you want with it :) If you haven't read the full novel before, I invite you to save the site to your HD and give it a whirl.
      </li>
      <li>
      <a href="http://userpages.umbc.edu/~lstave1/" target="_blank">UMBC Pub space</a> - I made this site in about one hour for a school course entitled "art and technology".
      </li>
      <li>
      <a href="http://home.jokerbone.com/portfolio/as/index.html" target="_blank">Acid*Sun</a> - Yet another quake 3 clan site, almost a year older.  <a href="http://pixeljuice.dhs.org/portfolio/as/smallsexy/UI.html" target="_blank">Here</a> is another try at it's UI. <a href="http://pixeljuice.dhs.org/energy/web/first/index.html" target="_blank">CSS blew my mind</a> while i was making the very first version of this site. I blame the ultra-simple final layout on this completely broken and disheartenting heap.
      </li>
      <li>
      <a href="http://home.jokerbone.com/portfolio/portfolio.html" target="_blank">beginnings 2</a> - This was a small portfolio site intended for cd-rom. I burned it and used it to get into the visual and performing art department at <a href="http://www.umbc.edu" target="_blank">UMBC</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
      <a href="http://home.jokerbone.com/portfolio/oldsites/beginnings/index.html" target="_blank">beginnings</a> - This is the first site I published fully to the web. In this rare case, my old <a href="http://members.nbci.com/curiousyelow/beginnings/index.html" target="_blank">xoom account</a> (surprisingly) still exists although I lost the ftp password long ago - go there for an earlier, original version of beginnings.
      </li>
      <li>
      <a href="http://home.jokerbone.com/portfolio/oldsites/Quasilateral/index.html" target="_blank">quasilateral</a> - Made up word for a title, high concept artwork, matrix ripoff graphics, frame navigation - what more could a first site need? I made this in a flurry of learning html and css, but it was only live on the web for a few days before I brought beginnings online.
