			<P><FONT SIZE="2">The original purpose of this web site was to demonstrate my experience in computer graphics through
			an online gallery. After finishing Quasilateral, my first true attempt at site creation, I wanted to extend my
			capablilities and make a nicer homepage. Because the content itself was essentially complete, this page only needed
			a graphical overhaul. At least that's what I thought going into it. Because I was teaching myself the whole way
			through, new concepts were constantly popping up. Hence the structural re-working evident in this site over Quasilateral.
			</FONT></P>

			<P><FONT SIZE="2">Basically, I wanted to emphasize the form of the Fibonacci sequence combined with a floppy diskette
			idea. Originally the concept used animated gifs to slide the disk door open in response to a javascript mouseover
			funtion. This proved too bulky, plus I got stuck on trying to get the various squares in the sequence to image
			map with the mouseover. I still don't know if this is even possible- surely it is, only not with javascript. After
			realizing this, I went back to the proverbial drawing board, or in this case, recycled paper sketch book, to work
			up a new concept for the page.</FONT></P>
			<P><FONT SIZE="2">Giving up on the motion graphics and along with it the 3DStudio rendered floppy diskette that
			would have allowed me the motion, I scanned an Imation <I>Neon</I> 3.5&quot; disk. I then took the scan into Photoshop
			and removed every trace of the Imation logo from the disk with the clone brush. The Golden Spiral square pattern
			was created in AutoCADR14, then screen-captured into PaintShop Pro 4. This I cropped and sent to Photoshop as a
			mask. Filling in the sequences with Frank Lloyd Wright style glass hues seemed to be the obvious next step. I then
			added a layer for each color block and made it glow and the label apear. An example of this can be found at the
			top of the page. Ideally, once I work out how to do it I will innact this look into an animation on the index.html
			page so that as one highlights a block, it glows and the label pops up.</FONT></P>
			<P><FONT SIZE="2">The decision to not use frames was prompted inpart by my general disapproval for how they appeared
			in different browsers on different systems. I also simply do not think they applied well to the concept. While
			I still haven't gotten everything I want out of cascading style sheets, I have set them up with beginnings to speed
			page loading and eliminate the cumbersome &lt;SPAN STYLE&gt; font tag used in Quasilateral.</FONT></P>
			<P><FONT SIZE="2">While creating Quasilateral I was able to use HotDog, a powerful code based HTML editor for the
			Windows platform. My copy was a 30-day trial version which is now defunct, forcing me to use Notepad and Symnatec's
			Visual Page in conjuntion.</FONT></P>

			<P><FONT SIZE="2">I am much more pleased with the overall aesthetic of beginnings but am already thinking of new
			UI's for the next implementation.</FONT>
